So I write a blog article about it. Possible other documentations are: My Projects is for bigger endeavors, usually documented on GitHub. My Diary has only short notes about each day in a year. Travel history about journeys, places I’ve been and people I’ve met. Leisure for shorter trips or good times with friends at nearby places. My Websites might actually have copies of the articles below. It sometimes depends where I start to write first, or if I translate an older German article to English. There is for example the website saiht.de/blog .

Hồ Chí Minh ( Su Pham university ). I am in Hanoi for a wedding and will only return to Saigon on November 7th. Two other students are still in China and wait for their visa. So the meeting was held on Google Meet. Well, Google products don’t work in China, neither does zoom. Maybe Microsoft Teams will work on Wednesday. It was also another step to update this vault. The pages My Websites , My Projects and About the blog were created and linked. I think I make this a separate subcategory different from Blog, since it documents the progressing steps of Obsidian and Quartz. Canvas and Graphs for example are not yet supported in Quartz v4 out of the box. And another attempt was to include a create date and some tags in the frontmatter of each page. Maybe a keyword cloud like from WordPress can be created. One result: The create date overwrites the save date from GitHub when displaying the page on Quartz 4. This is helpful. Maybe I include an updated tag, but with GitHub this should be automatically be done, I think. Read more at https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/folder-and-tag-listings . It seems some things are automatically generated and listed. And for consistency I created an overview or landing page for this vault.

I left 12.12.2025 Friday: The Black Virgin Mountain ( núi Bà Đen ) is only 2.5 hours away from the Su Pham university. My lesson finishes at 11:30, so I could be there at 14:00. I finally decide to eat lunch first, so I leave at 12:10 and arrive at 14:30. Which is a little too late, the guard for the easy hiking trail won’t let anyone hike up the mountain after 14:00. Without a break it takes 2 hours to get to the top. I would arrive there at 16:00 or later, and still have to buy a ticket down. The temple and tourist area on top of the mountain has been expanded by the Sun group, one can spend some time there. It is a little too much for my schedule today. I enter the area for 10k VND and walk to the different pagoda’s that are constructed at the lower part of the mountain at 200 to 300 meter height. There are 3 cable cars from the bottom to this area (only the Chùa Hang one works), another new one connects to the top of the mountain ( Hòa Đồng to Tâm An ). And the direct connection is from Nhà Ga Bà Đen station to Vân Sơn at 986 meters. There is an old path up to the mountain with stairs all the way up to 350 meters. Even the guard rails next to the stairs have been painted in yellow recently. But some upper sections have been washed away, and only a boulder trail remains. At 400 meters height it is more and more overgrown, and increasing in difficulty. The heat map on Strava shows that very few continue this path. It might be an option for another day. Above 750 meters the trail from the top becomes more visible again on Strava. But what about the section in between? Last time been here: December 2021 .

This time it is a HP Z600 Workstation - my first Xeon, workstation and dual-cpu machine. 18.11.2018 19.11.2018 20.11.2018 21.11.2018 22.11.2018 23.11.2018 24.11.2018 25.11.2018 26.11.2018 27.11.2018 28.11.2018 29.11.2018 30.11.2018 In our IB Physics lesson about oscillations we investigate the relationship between the length of a pendulum and it’s period (frequency). The collected data is entered in a dataset at Kaggle and started to be analyzed by a Jupyter Notebook and Pandas. See https://www.kaggle.com/code/kreier/frequency-of-a-pendulum .

A review of old files with horizontal alignment showed, that I need 600 columns for divisions of 10 years each.

It’s about scale, orientation (horizontal versus vertical) and a more precise vector design. 05.06.2023 06.06.2023 07.06.2023 08.06.2023 09.06.2023 10.06.2023 The GitHub repository was opened: https://github.com/kreier/timeline .

The switches in question are 6x6x7.3mm large. And I found a video about them on youtube and what their problem is. Technically the Kailh silent (why yellow) switches should last, but Reddit and Youtube comments indicate that this charge seem to have problems. I ordered 6 red ones on February 16th, 2025.

But what is pure worship? 6 points to identify: Matthew 4:10 pure must be directed to Jehovah John 16:27 One must also love and learn about Jesus John 17:17 Must be based on God’s word, the truth Matthew 24:14 You must be involved in the preaching work worldwide John 13:34, 35 Others will be able to identify because of the self sacrificing love John 15:17 No part of the world 3 ways that Jesus was a champion of pure worship: Matthew 4:10 real temptations, use your powers selfishly, Jehovah hasn’t provided for you with food, make spectacle, and you can get your kingdom earlier! Jesus answer: “It is Jehovah alone you must render sacred service” John 2:16, 17 “Take these things away from here”, the zeal for your house will consume me, he was zealous for pure worship John 4:23, 24 immortality of the soul? Not found in the scriptures, but Greek scholars promoted it. Therefore: in spirit and TRUTH to worship, and Jesus championed for it, he upheld the truth 16.08.2025 Saturday - The zeal for your house will consume me. Learn more about John the Baptist, Andrew, Peter, John, James, Philip and Nathanael 17.08.2025 Sunday - Worship the Father with spirit and truth. Lessons From What Jesus Said: “Born From Water and Spirit” (John 3:3, 5), “No Man Has Ascended Into Heaven” (John 3:13), “Come to the Light” (John 3:19-21), “I Am He” (John 4:25, 26), “My Food” (John 4:34), “The Fields … Are White for Harvesting” (John 4:35). The public bible discourse was themed: Do You Worship What You Know? But not a new problem. See Jesus in John 4:22 You worship what you do not know ; Romans 10:2 They have a zeal for god, but not according to accurate knowledge , Romans 12:1 serving God that is acceptable, with your power of reason (logicos), logical. Things that don’t satisfy our mind have no right to satisfy your heart. We are encouraged to really search for the truth: Accept that truth does exist (example story from a village with 6 blind man, try to perceive what an elephant is: Like a wall, tree, spear, snake, fan, rope - different opinions) Take your search for truth seriously Give the Bible and unbiased examination Reject falsehood 18.08.2025 19.08.2025 20.08.2025 21.08.2025 22.08.2025 23.08.2025 24.08.2025 25.08.2025 26.08.2025 27.08.2025 28.08.2025 29.08.2025 30.08.2025 31.08.2025 September 2025 01.09.2025 Monday, the start of a new service year! In service with Hiếu in Nha Trang. Walking on the railroad tracks like in India, talking to a woman on the bridge. Are her prayers answered when burning money? Don’t know yet, it’s the first time! Evening at the Armenian restaurant in Nha Trang with friends. 02.09.2025 Tuesday is Independence day of Vietnam and this year is a big celebration in Vietnam since it’s now 50 years. Fireworks in Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh, but it’s raining on the way back home. Arrived shortly before midnight. 03.09.2025 04.09.2025 05.09.2025 06.09.2025 07.09.2025 08.09.2025 09.09.2025 10.09.2025 11.09.2025 12.09.2025 13.09.2025 14.09.2025 15.09.2025 16.09.2025 17.09.2025 18.09.2025 19.09.2025 20.09.2025 21.09.2025 22.09.2025 23.09.2025 24.09.2025 25.09.2025 26.09.2025 27.09.2025 28.09.2025 29.09.2025 30.09.2025 October 2025 01.10.2025 02.10.2025 03.10.2025 04.10.2025 05.10.2025 06.10.2025 Returning from Can Tho in the afternoon. We measure the span width of the Cần Thơ Bridge while in the car with GPS for an average speed of 79 km/h and stop the time between the pillars to be 25 seconds. This gives us a distance of 548 meters, close to the actual 550 meters. d i s t an ce = 79 h k m ​ × 1 k m 1000 m ​ × 3600 s 1 h ​ × 25 s = 548 meter 07.10.2025 Tuesday: I am leaving Vietnam for Cambodia to get my student visa processed. But it will be the afternoon when I arrive at the Mộc Bài border crossing , so the office at the Su Pham university is forwarding my papers only the next day to the immigration office. Now it’s 6 working days to wait in Phnom Penh, starting with October 8th. 08.10.2025 09.10.2025 10.10.2025 11.10.2025 12.10.2025 13.10.2025 14.10.2025 15.10.2025 16.10.2025 Thursday morning: My invitation letter is there! After a coffee at Tube coffee I head to the embassy to deliver a printout of my documents. But it’s not the simple 145 USD fee for the 1-year multi-entry visa. For that you have to wait 5 business days until October 22nd. You can get it after “just” three working days on Monday for 165 USD , or on this Thursday for 205 USD . It should be written in Vietnamese in some circular that this 40% price increase is justified for this “express service” of a 5 minute printout work. Life in Phnom Penh has its costs, too. So I decide to wait until Monday as the most cost-effective option. The trip to Hanoi is coming up! 17.10.2025 18.10.2025 19.10.2025 Finally my 1-year-visa 20.10.2025 Monday morning I visit the embassy at 8:00 AM, right when they open. My visa should be prepared, I submitted the documents last Thursday already. But I will have to wait 2 more hours until I finally get my visa and can return to Vietnam! And I even register my pink book at the local police station for the next year. 21.10.2025 Create the Quartz repository for the web version of my Obsidian vault, aka diary. https://kreier.github.io/quartz/ 22.10.2025 Got my new roommate registered at the police! Negotiating updates to rent, fridge and AC. 23.10.2025 Thursday: It is time to repair the motorbike including several holes in the rear tire. It’s actually 2 years old and has 20,000 km behind it! But it should last the next 5,000 km for the road trip to Hanoi. Start of the Second Road Trip to Hanoi 24.10.2025 It is Friday morning, no time for breakfast. The motorbike is repaired, the holes in the tires are fixed, I am ready for the long planed second motorbike journey from Saigon to Hanoi: Part 1 is Saigon - Măng Đen 624.1 km, see Three day journey to Hanoi 2025 25.10.2025 Saturday is a day in the rain for the whole day. Therefore I only make it to Huế 420.2 km and join the weekend meeting on zoom. 26.10.2025 Sunday morning it is still raining in Hue, but after a few hours it stops when I arrive in Vinh. Sunset in Hanoi is at 18:00 and by 20:00 I am at Hoàn Kiếm Lake in Hà Nội after 650.4 km First day as student 27.10.2025 Monday: It is the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City ( Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh ) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam ( Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam ). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours (since I am in Hanoi ) and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are still in China and are waiting for their visa. I added a page to my Obsidian vault under Official start of my study at Su Pham and Extension of a few projects . Later I was checking the weather, there should be sunshine in Sapa and Fansipan on Wednesday! It is a one day trip. Should I go there? I guess so. I checked out the location of the kingdom hall for the wedding on Friday, took a picture, visited Vinhomes Times City in Hanoi , and parked at the McDonalds there. Special offer to get the coffee cheaper, continue digital planning for the next few days. From Hanoi to Sapa 28.10.2025 Tuesday: It is too early for the Yamaha dealers in the city to open, and at 7:00 AM the streets are already packed and full of traffic jams. Let’s just leave the city and do the oil change later. Finally did it at Yamaha Ba Vi , the Yamaha town a town earlier was moved and Google Maps not updated yet. As it turns out, the front fender is broken (one screw hole has the plastic broken out). And the brake pad is down to the metal and needs to be replaced. Didn’t I just replace it? Check my diary, it was 14.6.2023 - more than 2 years ago! Odo back then was just 13025 kilometers, we are now at 42477 km. And I need to change the ball bearings for the front wheel. Didn’t I change this recently as well? Yes, December 2024 after the road trip around the Tonle Sap in Cambodia and a visit to Siem Reap and Battambang. Odo then 28035 km. Well, then let’s fix that! Including oil change for the motor and rear tire gearbox and labour just 500,000 VND or 16.30 Euro. It turned out to be a great preparation for Sapa (1400m) and the trail to Fansipan (1900m starting height) and the whole Ha Giang loop a week later. I arrived in Lào Cai at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit the train station and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. With my multi-entry visa it is no problem, get the stamp and need only 15 minutes for the border crossing. Hekou on the other side has a special marking next to the border building as the “lowest southernmost point of China” with an elevation of only 76.2 meters . My Apple watch confirms the height. It’s dark already, some men watched my bike and got 10,000 VND. The climb to Sapa with my bike starts, a new bridge at 700 m height will make the journey easier soon. Sapa starts at 1300 metres and extends to 1450 meters. It’s another 12.5 kilometers or 23 minutes to the Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn on 1900 meters . Closed at night, can I start there tomorrow? Not without a guide, as explained during my stay at the SAPA HUB hostel & trekking for 150,000 VND in the dormitory with a great buffet breakfast! Dropped my Apple Watch Series 6 in the shower, now the glass is broken. That’s the third Apple watch this year! It’s still working, but the fix at Chiêm Tài will be 400,000 VND on 2025-11-11. Actually 700,000 VND since the touch input layer has to be replaced as well. Still cheaper than Fenix 7 of my hike mates the next day. And it recorded 50% of the trail! Hiking to Fansipan up and down 29.10.2025 Wednesday: I start the day relaxed with a breakfast 7:00 AM, then refill at the gas station. Check out the Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn for a future tour at 9:00 AM, and yes - you need a guide ! Two South Africans are there and get their guide, so I join them for 1,200,000 VND. We start 9:30 and have great weather and conversations. Schutte Venter does Ultra Trails with 100 kilometers in 18 hours, and his wife is a similar fit. Good that they take the “old man” (me into consideration. Eventually it’s the 5th fastest time recorded on Strava, and I am completely exhausted. Hitted the wall (bonking in biking) for me? 5:30 it got dark with sunset. We could still see a little, but used the flashlight from 6:30 to 7:30 when we finally arrived. Probably. 9:00 PM I’m not driving to Lào Cai but staying at the SAPA HUB hostel, I’m done. I was driving back with just 20 km/h and it took twice the time! The muscle pain stayed for another week! I could not take the stairs the normal way for the next 6 days. Returning to Hanoi 30.10.2025 Thursday: Will I be able to visit the Trung Tam congregation in the evening? It was my plan, but as soon as I entered the house of Nhung’s younger sister there was nowhere to go. I had a great time, though! Wedding of Ngọc Trâm and Thái 31.10.2025 Friday: Hanoi is a strange place. The streets are way to narrow for cars, but somehow you get a car and a motorbike passing on these narrow roads. And patiently everyone is moving at snails speed. While it simply won’t stop raining. With the car we arrive dry and safe at the kingdom hall. It is the official Wedding day of Ngọc Trâm and Thái Hanoi. Earlier the week was the ceremony at Tram’s family house in Nha Trang, now it’s the Kingdom Hall. And tomorrow it will be the at the house of the bridegroom. November 2025 Second day of the wedding 01.11.2025 Saturday: We have to drive to Long Bien to the home of Thai. In front of the house of his parents a large tent for 300 people is prepared. The invitation reads 11:00 am, but Tram wrote us already that times in the north are different, it starts at 10:00. And we can arrive earlier. We actually arrive shortly after 9:00 and the place is already packed! The long journey from Hanoi to Lung Cu 02.11.2025 This Sunday is the starting point for a 3-day-trip through the Ha Giang Lopp, followed by a 3-day-journey back to Saigon. It is a lot of driving, but it also includes great scenery in the mountains, and finally a Typhoon blocking my way! Read more about the first day at Travel: Ha Giang Loop: The long journey to Lũng Cú Initially I wanted to pick up Minh at the airport after she said farewell to her parents. But I meet with Markus for the first time for real in Hanoi, and before you know it’s much later. It is still slightly raining, and I can’t leave the family of Nhung’s relatives without having a meal, and get things packed. Even after 3 days my long pants are not dry yet. But I have no option. Since Minh want’s to pick up a better helmet at her sister’s house we meet there We start in Hanoi with rain at 3:00 pm. 1.5 hours later and outside of Hanoi the rain finally stops. But we have a long journey ahead, our homestay is in Lung Cu, the northernmost point of Vietnam ! Google maps states 10 hours for the 429 km trip. But that’s without breaks, rain, fog, and the cold temperatures in 1400m height on an unknown curvy road in darkness on pothole roads with a motorbike. After 6 hours we arrive in Hà Giang at 9:00 pm and refill the Yamaha NVX. Some 150 kilometers left, but because of the terrain this should take us 4 hours. We would arrive at 1:00 am. Should we eat a little com and have a break? Or continue driving. We decide to continue driving. The motorbike might need energy, but we do not. Leaving Hà Giang we decide to fill up the gas tank completely, since it is almost 10:00 pm. There might be gas stations on the way to Lung Cu, but they will probably be closed. Which turned out to be true, it was a good decision. And it started to rain again, while the temperature dropped as we gained height. At 11:00 pm we arrived at Cổng Trời Quản Bạ ( Quan Ba Heaven Gate ) in 1400 meter height. The rain had stopped, but for the rest of the journey we would often be in clouds. The light would only shine some 20 meters, and the visor of the helmet would be constantly covered in mist. Anyway, we were driving slowly enough to be save in the darkness. At 3:00 am on Monday we finally arrived at Cột Cờ Lũng Cú . Nhưng and Cuồng were still awake and welcomed us with a hot Ginger tea. We were frozen and tired, but happy to have made the journey safe, even if it took 12 hours. And Nhưng renamed me to Thiên Sứ (angel) instead of Thiên Phú, since we did not eat and drink for 12 hours! 03.11.2025 Travel: Ha Giang loop: Phố Cổ and Đồng Văn 04.11.2025 Travel: Ha Giang loop: Cốc Pảng and Du Gia Panorama Ecolodge 05.11.2025 Travel: Wednesday, time to leave Ha Giang. But we start with a great sunrise: 06.11.2025 I can’t drive as far Quảng Ngãi 636.1 km, since a Typhoon is blocking my way. 07.11.2025 Friday is a day driving through storm territory. Devastation wherever you look. Some roads are blocked by fallen trees for both lanes, only on the shoulder on one side can be used alternatively. This goes on for hours on the trip back to Saigon. Near Quy Nhon you see entire columns of trees toppled over on new developed areas. You see roofs lying on rice fields. 08.11.2025 Circuit Assembly “ Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations ”. Two sisters get baptized in Thanh Đa. 09.11.2025 Circuit Assembly Vietnamese in Thanh Đa: “ Hãy nghe những gì thần khí nói với các hội thánh ” First in-person lesson at the university 10.11.2025 Monday: The first time studying at Sư Phạm in person! The 15 minute drive takes 40 minutes, so a little later. Our lessons are 8:30 to 11:30, and our second teacher has an even longer journey from Nha Be. Our Korean student is missing this week. Hopefully next week we’re finally all together as a class in person! 4 students from China, and Phô Mai from Laos. With me we are 7 students from 4 nations. Meeting with Simon in the afternoon at Crescent Mall, and I realised the price range for professional sports watches from Garmin. My hiking partners at Fansipan had Fenix 7 watches, currently Fenix 8 is on sale for 31M VND or 1176 USD for the 51mm model (AMOLED, with MicroLED more 55M VND or 2049 USD). But it also has 29 days standby or 84 hours of GPS tracking, easily outpacing my Apple Watch. Should I upgrade? My broken watch is in repair for 700k because of the broken display from October 28th. Later I got a guided tour to the Climbing area by Simon. When is our climbing day? If you get the ticket 10-12 am it’s reduced to 210,000 VND for the whole day until 10 pm. Renting shoes is 50k, safety harness another 50k or a combo of 70k. Now I have to find a day to use this offer. Evening preparation for the midweek meeting. Currently we read the Song of Solomon or Canticles, and we listened to the audio recording with at least 5 different voices! 11.11.2025 Tuesday . Picked up my repaired Watch Series 6, and dropped two microphones at the KH. It is the only day with the lesson in the afternoon 13:00 to 16:00. 12.11.2025 13.11.2025 Thursday: Next week is teachers day, on 2025-11-20. But some departments have the celebration on other days, our department KHOA NGỮ VĂN (Faculty of language and literature) is celebrating on Tuesday, November 18. So we’ll meet at 8:00 AM, and there is no afternoon lesson. The song the students sing for their students becomes our practice, and I make 24 mistakes in the 13 lines putting the correct tones on the words. That’s how challenging the listening still is for me. Wedding of Johnnie and Haylie 14.11.2025 Friday: Finally another 5k run. Ready by 5:20, but only out at 5:35 with some fog. At least it is dry after the rain yesterday. Still with a pace over 6 minutes, but it’s been a while. Breakfast 35k with Set Tỉnh Táo ( Bánh mì ốp la and Pha Phin Cà Phê Sữa L - previously Combo A lớn). I open my old Sabbatical diary - a whole year is missing! It needs to be synced with a future Obsidian vault, and some parts of multiple imports to a wordpress blog. The German parts from 2008 to 2010 probably need some translation. Until 11:00 AM we are already at November 2025 and update today! Got new fresh Arabica beans coffee from Sơn Nam, packed just today and originating from Cầu Đất ( The Coffee Farm Cầu Đất ) near Dalat (38 minutes, 24 km) for now 380,000 VND/kg. With Simon we’ll leave at 2:00 to be on time at the KH for Johnnie and Haylie’s wedding. They have a great story , compiled for the internet. The picture above is from July 5th, 2025 in Dalat, when Haylie accepted!. 15.11.2025 Talk: Hãy tiếp tục phát triển mối quan hệ với Ðức Chúa Trời. 16.11.2025 17.11.2025 Teachers day 18.11.2025 Tuesday. Teacher day is two days earlier for our department and starts at 8:00 am and there is no afternoon lesson. Go climbing at Crescent mall in the afternoon? It’s a great time with our group, all 7 students are together. And the students prepare a good show for the teachers. 19.11.2025 It is the first time that all 7 students are together in one room! 20.11.2025 With 7 students from 4 countries we write some greetings for the teachers day on the blackboard in 8 languages. But today Phô Mai is missing. The remaining students with Dr. Tâm: 21.11.2025 22.11.2025 Talk: Tìm nơi đâu sự giúp đỡ trong những lúc đau buồn? 23.11.2025 Sunday: VEX Vietnam Road to National: Southern Qualification Season 25-26 , see this vex-ssis.github.io website about the event. In the afternoon I met with Kiệt and Hiểu at L’Espace de Dong Gia | Coffee Beans | Tea Leaves | Workshop in district 2. The largest Decathlon of the city should be at the Vincom Megamall there. Finally we closed the day in a restaurant with new friends. 24.11.2025 25.11.2025 26.11.2025 27.11.2025 Thursday: Since Dr. Tâm has a day off, I can start the journey to Gò Công with Hiểu earlier, pick him up at 11:00 at Trần Đại Nghĩa school, arrive shorty after noon there and have a great afternoon. Back in town in time at 6:00 pm! 28.11.2025 29.11.2025 Talk: “Không thuộc về thế gian”—Theo gương của Đấng Ki-tô 30.11.2025 December 2025 01.12.2025 02.12.2025 03.12.2025 04.12.2025 05.12.2025 Circuit assembly in Xuân Trường 06.12.2025 Saturday: The south-eastern congregations like Nha Trang have their assembly in Xuân Trường at the connected kingdom halls. According to Google Maps 2h39 for 101km with a two-wheeler (my NVX). Start early at 6:00 with breakfast, drive from 6:30 to 9:09 and get ready before the program starts with music at 9:40 for “ Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations ”. Visit to Trảng Bàng 07.12.2025 Sunday: A week ago I was invited by Xương and Linh to visit them at their congregation , since Xuong is giving a talk. That’s my journey on this Sunday, and we spend time together until the afternoon. The new kingdom hall is already 3 years old. But only a month ago the 4 air conditioners were installed - and it’s a big difference! Prior to that it was rather hot, you hear the dogs barking from outside, or neighbours with their Karaoke. Now you can easily focus on your study. We also visit the house of Xương and Linh in Trảng Bàng. They do not switch on the A/C (real Asians) and have only 150,000 VND for electricity. Rent? Some 1.2tr and they don’t even use the “second floor”, a kind of mezzanine above the kitchen and bathroom. Maybe I should move out of the city. Even the visa run to Cambodia would be shorter! 08.12.2025 09.12.2025 10.12.2025 11.12.2025 Journey to Núi Bà Đen 12.12.2025 Friday: Black Virgin Mountain - Núi Bà Đen is only 2.5 hours away from the Su Pham university. My lesson finishes at 11:30, so I could be there at 14:00. I finally decide to eat lunch first, so I leave at 12:10 and arrive at 14:30. Which is a little too late, the guard for the easy hiking trail won’t let anyone hike up the mountain after 14:00. Without a break it takes 2 hours to get to the top. I would arrive there at 16:00 or later, and still have to buy a ticket down. The temple and tourist area on top of the mountain has been expanded by the Sun group, one can spend some time there. It is a little too much for my schedule today. I enter the area for 10k VND and walk to the different pagoda’s that are constructed at the lower part of the mountain at 200 to 300 meter height. There are 3 cable cars from the bottom to this area (only the Chùa Hang one works), another new one connects to the top of the mountain ( Hòa Đồng to Tâm An ). And the direct connection is from Nhà Ga Bà Đen station to Vân Sơn at 986 meters. There is an old path up to the mountain with stairs all the way up to 350 meters. Even the guard rails next to the stairs have been painted in yellow recently. But some upper sections have been washed away, and only a boulder trail remains. At 400 meters height it is more and more overgrown, and increasing in difficulty. The heat map on Strava shows that very few continue this path. It might be an option for another day. Above 750 meters the trail from the top becomes more visible again on Strava. But what about the section in between? Last time been here: December 2021 . And next time will be a successful ascent and descent: January 2026 13.12.2025 Saturday: Visit of Thiên Phú to our congregation! The public talk is , but there are also 5 points to consider for each of us: 14.12.2025 Sunday: My second time Pickle Ball. This time no fever, and no significant back pain. At least I don’t need Paracetamol. 15.12.2025 It is time to make progress in this Obsidian vault. Now over 12,000 words and a total of 46 minutes to read. I still have to figure out a good way to structure the diary in a visually pleasing way. Probably a few pictures will make it much nicer, and a paragraph per day should be sufficient. The Daily notes should be included into the Blog, then it is only 5 categories. 16.12.2025 This diary has already grown to 11744 words and would require 44 minutes to read. Should I start a spreadsheet for documentation? 17.12.2025 18.12.2025 The spreadsheet from Monday exist, but that’s tedious. What about automation? Remember that 2022-2023 you were actually teaching Advanced Automation ? This can be automated, too. Time to start a new repository: https://github.com/kreier/statistics-diary 19.12.2025 20.12.2025 21.12.2025 We get our new fridge Toshiba Inverter 233 lít GR-RT303WE-PMV(52)! The old LG was broken for 5 months now, and I rarely used it anyway, since it needed some 2.4 kWh every day. The new one has two inverters (for the compressor and fan on the expansion side) and needs only 1/3 of the energy compared to the old LG GR-212DL! And it has 21 liters more space, while the convection oven for pizza still fits above it. 22.12.2025 23.12.2025 24.12.2025 25.12.2025 26.12.2025 It’s the last day of school at the university, and we want to be finished with chapter 5 of book 5. Since we started 7 weeks later we are a little behind schedule. This Friday marks our midterm review test for semester 1. Then it’s two weeks off! The test at 13:30 shows: I need to work on my pronunciation (phát âm). It’s exactly how Ben told me 9 years ago: “Get the tones right”! After 1h30 we’re all finished, and go as a group (without Phô Mai) to Kichi Kichi at the Vạn Hạnh Mall near our university. My first time at this buffet conveyer belt restaurant! 27.12.2025 28.12.2025 29.12.2025 30.12.2025 31.12.2025 Statistics 2025 So far there are 46 days documented. And 17 days have an extended documentation. Currently 4973 words, it would take 19 minutes to read.

The last trip was on December 12th, Journey to Núi Bà Đen . And first visit was during Covid times, on December 24th, 2021. Now, more than 4 years later, I finally make it to the top.

We started 5:00 AM, but it took only a little over 2 hours to get there this early and on a weekend. I added the location to Google Maps. 12.01.2026 Sightseeing Saigon.

Our Zalo group was curious yesterday, but the start is postponed by another week! Time for self study. I get some end-rolls for my physical printouts of the Timeline project. 40k for 10 rolls in 20cm length, but usually one end has a hanger screwed in. I removed them, and filed the two holes down. Can I just order without the hanger? I visited the store in district 12, same price - but they would just throw away the other part, they don’t produce this. If I only use 50% this would mean 8k per printout instead of 4k. Sad that it comes down to price. And I started a new repository for the timeline as html: kreier.github.io/tl . 20.01.2026 I reactivate the old igshcmc.de domain and direct it to a Github page. It works easy and fast! After being abandoned for almost 10 years (registered September 26th, 2016, see September 2016 ) it is still only 0,50 Euro per month, including 2GB of mail storage and 10 subdomains. Let’s see what projects I’m going to use it for. 21.01.2026 22.01.2026 23.01.2026 24.01.2026 25.01.2026 26.01.2026 27.01.2026 28.01.2026 29.01.2026 30.01.2026 31.01.2026 February 2026 01.02.2026 02.02.2026 03.02.2026 04.02.2026 05.02.2026 06.02.2026 07.02.2026 08.02.2026 09.02.2026 This took a while. Finally visiting RE COM again to repair my Thinkpad X370 I also took the M590 from Logitech with me to have the Kailth Silent installed. Price to solder in two buttons: 20,000 VND - less than a dollar (fro a year ago: February 2025 .

I wanted to put it in to my Penta-GPU server i3-6100 in early 2025. Today I realized that I can just rent this GPU at Kaggle! Since I have an old account since November 2018 I can easily start my benchmark from a browser and save 5 million VND! Here is the benchmark: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kreier/opencl-benchmark 19.02.2026 Benchmarking my Penta-GPU server i3-6100 : The larger 24GB 30B nematron-3-nano is more than 4x faster compared to similar sized models because of the MoE architecture! It might be useful for my privacy oriented OpenClaw agentic engineering project. 20.02.2026 I try to import the commits to Sourceforge for my ar65view program. I change the names of the author (my nickname saiht ) to my own name - and now my Github history goes back to 2011! Just with the new ar65view-svn repository.

For the Socket 1150 it was actually cheaper than a similar i5-4590 (350k vs. 460k VND) for the same 4C/4T and 3.3-3.7 GHz. As I found out, it also has the HD 4600 GPU integrated! A little unusual for a Xeon, but here we are! RAM upgrade to 10 GB For just 200k you get a 8GB DDR3 1600 memory DIMM. And then it is useable with Windows 10.

For a little more than a year the ChatGPT revolution is unfolding, and the question lingers “Can I do something like this myself”? Some similar models have been made available for free, so you can run them locally on your own machine. But better models are also bigger. So what do you need? A lot of RAM and a lot of compute power. That’s what I went for: an older datacenter CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads for a lot of parallel compute power, and 128 GB DDR3 ECC RAM. Really expensive 10 years ago, surprisingly affordable in early 2024. Here is my setup from 20. February 2024. CPU: 18 Cores and 36 Threads Officially this CPU does not even exist on Intel’s website. You can only find some information on Wikipedia, it seems to be a unique model tailored for Amazon. Even Linus Tech Tips made a video about this CPU when it was still $4500 USD! Its actually the E5 2699 v3 - this one does exist on the Intel webpage - but the 2696 I have is OEM made to also support DDR3 and has a higher boost clock of 3.8 GHz (multiplier 15 instead of 13). See here on Wikipedia . RAM: 128 GB 1866 ECC Even more surprising, it’s only 350,000 VND per 32 GB DIMM, the total 128 GB cost only 1,400,000 VND or 54 USD. With the price surge at the end of 2025 this would be 2024-02-20 Build I got all the materials form https://vitinhgiaphat.com/ and started assembling. Initially I wanted to unlock more power, frequency etc of the CPU. But in many cases I just ran into the thermal limitation and the 145W power limit. 2025-01-16 Water cooling This idea was lingering for a year now, and I finally placed the order for my first water cooling block. By now the AIOs are reliable and affordable, so I ordered one VSP VCR-240 at Lazada for 630,000 VND or 24 USD. 2025-01-27 Include in mining rig With so many cores, could it be of use for mining? The good days are long over, but for CPU there is at least Monero left. So I gave it a try: No, 1200 kH is not a lot. A few years ago 18 cores sound a lot, but in 2025 some i3 get close to that core count. I wanted to sell this machine, since the memory speed was not sufficient for the LLM models in early 2025. Windows 10 was installed and updated. I put in my RX 470 GPU and was about to offer it on Chotot. But then it started collecting dust. 2026-01-26 Davinci Resolve 20 Thanh talked about his project to work with video editing software. But they all require a lot of RAM, whether on iPad, PC or Mac. And a dedicated machine for either is not cheap. Well, why not try this 128 GB machine with 18 cores? Just give it a try. So I installed Davinci Resolve 20 and it worked out of the box without problems. I tested the AMD RX470 with my KG 4K monitor - no problem, even HDR10 works. The old GPU is not the limit here. And with RAM and 18 cores it should be able to handle effects, while one might to wait a little though.

But if I ran the machine only from time to time, then the power consumption is not the main concern. And both my HP ProDesk 600 G4 mini i5-8500T and HP Pro Mini 400 G9 have vPro, not just WOL (Wake On Lan). Can I have something that also fits one or two GPUs for faster inference on LLMs? Looking through Chotot I found a few options, and the price of an industry build PC in the secondary market beats anything I can build myself. I get updates for BIOS way longer, and have the professional features like vPro integrated, because system admins in companies don’t walk from desk to desk to manage all the clients there. Again looking for the 8th generation to have Windows 11 support, I found an i7-8700 machine from HP. The 800 series has more options than the smaller 600 and 400 series, sometimes only labeled ProDesk. We go EliteDesk! CPU i7-8700 8C/12T The cooling block and fan are surpisingly small inside the machine. I have some experience with HP computers. Since 2018 I owned a ___ Z600 HP workstation with dual Xeon as my daily workhorse. Despite a power draw of 180 Watt when idle this machine was quiet. Now the Elitedesk is not inteded to be a workstation, but for office workers. And indeed, in idle on Windows 11 it only draws 11 Watt! The powerful i7 CPU can throttle down and use very little power, therefore needs little cooling, and the fan can stay quiet. What a useful combination! 2025-01-09 RAM upgrade to 40 GB On Shopee I ordered two 16 GB Micron DDR4 2666 MHz modules for 501,500 VND each. That’s 19.38 USD.

And it renders 4K indeed, I checked the console and terminal on my 4K monitor. But the rest is rather discouraging: CPU Rockchip RK3229 with 4x Cortex-A7 (ARMv7-A) 32bit with 1.4 GHz RAM 1 GB DDR3 HDD eMMC 8GB 100 MBit Ethernet adapter At least it got some Armbian support. I installed it on February 4th, 2024 on the eMMC and it’s still running in February 2026! Cortex-A7 was actually used in the Raspberry Pi2. 2024-02-03 Real hardware Above I stated the hardware values I could actually use. The box it came in claimed 16 GB RAM and 256 GB NVM, even the Android 7 kernel reported these values. But the hardware is just not there. Even the memory is a unique combination of DDR3 and eMMC in one chip that was once used in a Samsung Galaxy phone. Unsold parts seem to have a second life! At least Rockchip is supporting the Linux community, so the CPU has good support. It was really easy to install Armbian, and handles most tasks fine within its limitations. It runs Python 3.11.2 and gcc 12.2.0. The prime benchmark in Python was executed more than 4x faster than the Raspberry Pi 1 I got 2013. 2025-05-11 Speed test in Python and Prime The simple python program to test the speed of some other machines was also started on this little box. The first test were done very fast, even to 1,000,000 with the updated algorithm took 9.9 seconds. That’s 4.5x faster than the Raspberry Pi 1, is 8.8x faster than a ESP32 and 49x faster than a ESP8266 with 80MHz on Micropython. But the required time increases exponentially. It was 5 days later, on May 16, that the calculation to 2,147,483,647 was finished. And it took another 10 days to finish the calculation to 2E32-1: 4,294,967,295 after 894664.4 seconds or 10h8. Documented at GitHub . Speed in C? See below. How about the Arduino Mega 2560 that was connected to the USB port and reporting the result over serial? Arduino C could be faster, and with 8 kByte of RAM there is no way that Python would run. Still, only one core, 8 bit an 16 MHz it took 598.9 seconds to calculate the primes with the same algorithm on the Mega - 60x slower. 1400 MHz vs. 16 MHz87x more, 32bit vs. 8 bit is 8x more but Python vs. C is at least 10x slower. Even confirmed with the rk3229. 2026-02-05 Update The machine was running for a few months to be the power source and monitor for my Arduino MEGA 2560 running prime calculations (see here on GitHub ) and getting the output over minicom. Logging in over ssh to get the latest data. On 2026-02-01 I finally read out the data from the EEPROM: It took 2293885.75 seconds to calculate all primes until 1,000,000,000 calculated with the improved algorithm. With only 8 kByte of RAM the Mega has space for 3632 primes, so the largest is 33923. That’s enough to check the numbers until 1,150,769,929. It worked! 2293885.75 seconds is equal to 26 days. The software update brought the system now to Armbian 25.11.2 + bookworm with a 6.1.63 LTS kernel. Armbian will probably continue to use Debain 12 (Bookworm) for a little while longer. Support until 2028 is planned. Speed in C The CPU was waiting for this. If it takes 10 days for Python to 2E32, how much faster would C be?

See the History below. The planned P100 with HBM2 is not that much faster than my 3070 Ti. The multi GPU solution is more flexible and has ultimately more VRAM. Here is how it looks inside: The graphic cards from left to right: P104-100, P106-100, GTX 1070 and P104-100. The LEDs on the mainboard indicate 3x green = PCIe Gen1 and 1x red = Gen3 for the 1070. CPU temperature currently at 34 degrees. For the boot process this display shows all kinds of other messages, states or errors. A) Mainboard EVGA Z170 4-way classified - broken I had seen the mainboard with 4 GPU slots a while ago for 600k, then reoffered at Chotot for 450k because one DIMM and one PCIe are broken. But everything else works, and a newer Z370 Gaming mainboard is 1,800k - significantly more expensive. This is just a hobby. B) CPU i3-6100 Initially I had planned to use a i5-6600 4C/4T 3.9 GHz but the seller of the Z170 mainboard offered a i3-6100 CPU for 250k. The difference? 2C/4T 3.7 GHz, for my use case almost not noticeable, and another cost saving. One day I could upgrade to a 7600K or 7700K when the prices go down (I lost that confidence early 2026). C) GPU cluster Combining 4 GPUs with a combined VRAM of 30 GB makes it possible to run larger models like the nemotron-3-nano with 30 billion parameters on this machine. As a MoE model the token generation is still very usable with about 40 tokens/s. The cluster currently has these 4 Pascal CC 6.1 GPUs: 2x P104-100 with 320 GB/s bandwidth P104-100 for 650k + 400k GTX 1070 256 GB/s GTX 1070 8GB for 2K VND P106-100 with 192 GB/s P106-100 for 500k Total cost: 3,550,000 VND or 136 USD or 115 Eur. Much cheaper than a DGX Spark for 4000 USD. GTX 1070 8GB After having a broken 1060 with 6GB and P106-100 with 6GB I was looking for more VRAM and visited some Chotot sellers for a 2080 Ti or 1080 Ti, only to find out that they had been sold. 11 GB sounded great! But I found a seller of the 1070 for only 2M VND, so I got one. At least I would be sure that the drivers would work, and I could use it for Gaming - just in case. Strangely, my much newer 3070 Ti also has only 8 GB of VRAM.

I have some DP-HDMI adapter lying around, so for 1600k a 6GB graphics card makes sense. The similar P104-100 is only 650k, but has no graphics whatsoever. I got one later. This GPU was then exported to the E3-1226 v3 with GTX 1060 server. D) Power consumption Idle - 75 Watt In idle the system needs 75 Watts. Using the internal GPU of the i3 instead of the 1070 reduced the power consumption by 10 Watt. With just 3 GPUs it was down to 60 W. That’s why the HD 530 shows up as fifth GPU and hence the name “Penta-GPU” instead of “Quadro’GPU” server. For LLMs we actually only use 4 GPUs, but want to reduce the power consumption. The PCIe bus reduces speed down to Gen1 to save energy, and the GPUs reduce frequency for their processor and memory. They report themselves to use 23 Watt combined: One GPU - 300 Watt If I only run a smaller 4.3B parameter model like Gemma 3 in Ollama, only one GPU will be tasked and use 100% of the 180 W power budget. The combined consumption is about 300 Watt at the wall. Response 48 token/s and prompt 466 token/s. My example question was “Explain the French revolution in about 1000 words.” All 35 layers are offloaded to GPU0. Four GPUs - 420 Watt Larger models like nemotron-3-nano spread their 31.6B parameter and 26GB GPU memory footprint each GPU gets a part of the processing, but only about 60 Watt each. Again all model layers (53) are offloaded to the GPU. Combined the system now needs up to 420 Watt from the wall: The response is 40 t/s and the prompt 120 t/s. Successive prompts are processed even faster with 435 and 438 t/s. For coding it easily produces a 200 lines python script to parse Markdown files in subfolders, remove YAML/TOML front matter, clean text, do word count, use Pandas, export as csv file. With 158 t/s for prompt and 40 t/s for response. Quite useful already! Now a coding agent with OpenClaw and a agentic coding model! E) History 2025-01-10 Original Plans with P40 and P100 My planning was a possible multi-GPU machine with the P100 GPU as main ingredient. With just 16 GB it has less VRAM than the similar Tesla P40 but has significant higher memory bandwidth because of HBM2 instead of GDDR5. And after the compute heavy prompt processing is done (not very long before the answer starts) it is memory bandwidth that limits the token generation. There is still some MATMUL going on, but even a CPU is sitting idle waiting for some data to multiply to arrive. Specification Tesla P40 Tesla P100 CUDA Cores 3,840 cores 3,584 cores Memory Type GDDR5 HBM2 Memory Capacity 24 GB 16 GB Memory Speed 1808 MHz 1,430 MHz Bandwidth 346 GB/s 720 GB/s Memory Bus Width 384-bit 4096-bit Max Power Consumption (TDP) 250 W 250 W The P100 is 267mm long and need some extra space for the fan (120mm for a 120 fan) that therefore does not fit into a HP ProDesk. This needs a dedicated build. As I will find out more than a year later 2026-02-18 P100 in the cloud the speed improvement would be not that significant. By then MoE models had sped up inference by almost one magnitude, so that again memory size would be a more limiting factor for useful local LLM models than just memory bandwidth. 2025-01-11 Case Xigmatek Cubi II (E-ATX) The new big E-ATX mainboard needs a bigger case. And the case is intended for the larger P100. This GPU needs more space to fit a 12cm fan in front of the card. Evaluating some options I landed at the Xigmatek Cubi II and got it locally at tnc for 1,090k. https://www.tnc.com.vn/case-xigmatek-alpha-cubi-ii-black-en45271.html Eventually I never got the P100, so there is some empty space in the case next to the GPUs. At least for now. 2025-01-27 Mining with three GPUs The intention for the initially 3 GPUs was to be used for LLMs, but as a benchmark test I also run some mining. Far from being profitable it is a good way to see the whole system maxed out: 2026-02-18 P100 in the cloud I noticed that I can use a P100 for free with my 7-year old Kaggle account from early 2019! Here is the link, below the result: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kreier/opencl-benchmark .-----------------------------------------------------------------------------. | Device ID 0 | Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB | |----------------'------------------------------------------------------------| | Device ID | 0 | | Device Name | Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB | | Device Vendor | NVIDIA Corporation | | Device Driver | 580.105.08 (Linux) | | OpenCL Version | OpenCL C 3.0 | | Compute Units | 56 at 1328 MHz (3584 cores, 9.519 TFLOPs/s) | | Memory, Cache | 16269 MB VRAM, 1344 KB global / 48 KB local | | Buffer Limits | 4067 MB global, 64 KB constant | |----------------'------------------------------------------------------------| | Info: OpenCL C code successfully compiled. | | FP64 compute 3.521 TFLOPs/s (1/3 ) | | FP32 compute 8.915 TFLOPs/s ( 1x ) | | FP16 compute 16.576 TFLOPs/s ( 2x ) | | INT64 compute 1.195 TIOPs/s (1/8 ) | | INT32 compute 3.118 TIOPs/s (1/3 ) | | INT16 compute 9.030 TIOPs/s ( 1x ) | | INT8 compute 1.823 TIOPs/s (1/4 ) | | Memory Bandwidth ( coalesced read ) 543.07 GB/s | | Memory Bandwidth ( coalesced write) 594.55 GB/s | | Memory Bandwidth (misaligned read ) 302.78 GB/s | | Memory Bandwidth (misaligned write) 90.43 GB/s | | PCIe Bandwidth (send ) 4.73 GB/s | | PCIe Bandwidth ( receive ) 5.19 GB/s | | PCIe Bandwidth ( bidirectional) (Gen3 x16) 4.60 GB/s | '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------' The HBM2 of the P100 is not that much faster than the GDDR6X of my 3070 Ti. Theoretically it should reach 732 GB/s (for 5699 USD in 2016) while the 3070 Ti has 608 GB/s. In real application its rather 594 GB/s vs. 575 GB/s. Not 20% faster but only 3% faster with an older CC 6.1 versus 8.9. See the benchmark here: https://kreier.github.io/benchmark/gpu/ Some of my PCIe ports both on the Z170 mainboard as well as the special crypto cards have some limitations. If I use all 4 slots then some slots get reduced from 16 lanes to only 8. And the P104-100 has only 4 of the 16 lanes connected, while running only Gen1. With 0.84 GB/s we see the maximum of 1 GB/s approaching. Generation x1 (1 Lane) x4 (4 Lanes) x8 (8 Lanes) x16 (16 Lanes) PCIe 1.0 0.25 GB/s 1.0 GB/s 2.0 GB/s 4.0 GB/s PCIe 2.0 0.50 GB/s 2.0 GB/s 4.0 GB/s 8.0 GB/s PCIe 3.0 0.985 GB/s 3.94 GB/s 7.88 GB/s 15.75 GB/s PCIe 4.0 1.969 GB/s 7.88 GB/s 15.75 GB/s 31.51 GB/s Meanwhile the slower P106-100 has all 16 lanes at Gen1 speed. An updated test on 2026-02-19 delivered up to 3.33 GB/s - 4x the speed of the P104-100. The GTX 1070 reports x16 bus is slowed down to Gen3 x8 on the Z170 Classified mainboard. With a theoretical 7.88 GB/s we indeed measured 5.69 GB/s for this card. 2026-02-19 Finally four GPUs for LLMs After getting another power splitter to supply four GPUs and carefully adding them to the system it finally worked: Four GPUs with 30 GB VRAM worked in unison. Now let’s get it some coding work to do! Auto powering down Ollama frees the GPU memory after not being used for 5 minutes (standard setting). I want to use this determine if the machine can go to suspension. I wanted to use sleep, but the Wake On Lan WOL of the Z170 board is implemented in a non-working way to target a maximum overclocking features. But S3 works, and a Raspberry Pico W rp2040 works as virtual keyboard to wake up the server over the network. New project for powering down It turns out, the Raspberry Pico W consumes too much power for Wifi. So when the penta goes to S3 suspension, there is not enough power for the Pico W to continue operating. We need less power! Maybe light sleep and BLE? That’s the very idea of a new project with an esp32c3 Supermini, called https://github.com/kreier/wob for WOB - Wake On Bluetooth. It will take some time to make it run. Inference speed on large 30B models January 2025 - 0.92 to 6.37 t/s In January 2025 I tried Qwen2.5:32b with 32.76B parameters and its 65 layers of 20 GB to fit into my 26 GB VRAM (8/6/6/6) machine. With 32 GB DDR4 I could run about 0.92 t/s from the CPU, limited by the memory bandwidth of about 32 GB/s. But I could not get the layers split and load into VRAM successfully. See ollama_multi_GPU.csv . With 3 GPUs (8/6/6) and 20 GB VRAM I could offload 80% to the GPU and got 21/14/15 layers there. The speed increased to 2.34 token/s. With a fourth GPU (8/6/6/6) I could get 98% of layers to the GPU: 19/15/15/15 and increased the inference to 5.11 token/s. Why not 100%? Just one more layer, you got already 21 into the 8GB GPU earlier! Well, I even commented on ollama Github about similar problems ( #7509 of ollama and I think in the time since then it has been fixed.) With the parameter num_gpu=65 I got all layers offloaded, but also had an unstable system and 6.37 t/s . January 2026 - 8.42 t/s Retest in 2026 with 30 GB of VRAM (8/8/8/6) and the layers are easily offloaded 18/18/18/11 and the inference is up to 8.42 token/s . About 10x as fast as the CPU, with memory up to 320 GB/s on GDDR5X. Newer MoE models - 38 t/s A comparable model in size in 2026 is now available with nemotron-3-nano with 31.6B parameters, 53 layers and 24 GB model size. The context window is no longer just 32K but 1M! Now more MoE models are available, and the general speed has further increased for the same hardware, while the quality of the models also improved. Even though the memory footprint is 4GB larger the model is significantly faster! I get 38 t/s instead of just 8, almost 5x the speed because of MoE. And the answer is also much more sophisticated. Here a few more details of the comparison: model size parameter context token/s prompt GPUs layers qwen2.5:32b 20GB 32.8B 32K 8 75 4 65 qwen3:32b 20GB 32.8B 40K 8 52 3 65 gemma3:27b 17GB 27.4B 128K 9 50 3 63 glm-4.7-flash:q4_K_M 19GB 29.9B 198K 25 81 3 48 nemotron-3-nano:30b 24GB 31.6B 1000K 38 116 4 53 gpt-oss:20b 14GB 20.9B 128K 42 238 2 25 gemma3:4b 4GB 4.3B 128K 45 322 1 35 Surprisingly the largest model in this 30B class is also the fastest: nemotron-3-nano. With its MoE architecture it rivals much smaller 20B and 4B models! All that on 10 year old hardware. Comparison of Nemotron-3 speed On February 7th, 2026, Alex Ziskind published a video of the NVIDIA DGX Spark for $4000 and it’s speed comparison to three similar products. In a later part he tested the very Nemotron-3-Nano-30B model (at 14:05) that I used, but in a non-quantized version (BF16 with 63.2 GB vs. Q4_K_M 24.6GB, 2.57x smaller). llama-bench pp4096 1068 t/s 14:48 (while I get 116 t/s, sometimes 450 t/s) llama-bench tg8196 throughput 61 token/s 12:49 (vs my 38 t/s just 60% faster ) power 63 Watt, 200 Watt from the wall 15:26 (versus 420 Watt, 6.7x or 450W wall, 2.25x) My prompt processing is 2-10x slower. But that’s just the initial start of generating the answer, usually just a few seconds. The very answer later is sometimes generated in several minutes. And here there is not much of a difference: 61 t/s vs. 38 t/s. Saved a few thousand dollars! The DGX Spark would be only 60% faster but with $136 for my 4 GPUs are 29x cheaper ! Qwen3-4B Let’s test the smaller model Qwen3-4B : llama-bench pp4096 throughput 1970 t/s (12:37) is 3x faster llama-bench tg8192 throughput 61.8 t/s (12:49) is only 2.6x faster Power: 65 Watt GPU, 150 Watt from the wall (12:19) is in total 2x lower The Qwen3:4B Q4_K_M is just 2.5GB and can run on a single P104-100 GPU. It only took a little longer to compile for the Pascal architecture, see GPU with CUDA Compiler 12.2 below. llama-bench pp4096 throughput 665 t/s llama-bench tg8192 throughput 23.5 t/s Power: 175 Watt GPU, 304 Watt from the wall The instructions: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 ./build/bin/llama-bench -m ~/.cache/llama.cpp/Qwen_Qwen3-4B-GGUF_Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 99 -p 4096 -n 8192 F) Build llama.cpp for Pascal This is not that easy. The latest stable Nvidia driver is from the 535 branch, currently 535.288.01. The CUDA compiler shipping with the 535 driver is 12.2, but this version does not support Ubuntu 24.04, only 20.04 and 22.04. Ubuntu 24.04 ships with gcc 13, but CUDA 12.2 only works with gcc 12. I was not able to get a working image with CUDA Compiler 12.9, the latest to support the Pascal architecture. Everything below CC 7.5 was dropped with version 13. I went for the older CUDA Toolkit 12.2 with the driver 535.288.01 (supporting my 4 Pascal GPUs) in the 22.04 variant. In summary the prerequisites that worked: Ubuntu 24.04 CUDA Toolkit 12.2 - you have to add the path variables by hand Nvidia driver 535.288.01 GCC and CPP v12 , not 13 Here the installation: wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.2.0/local_installers/cuda_12.2.0_535.54.03_linux.run sudo sh cuda_12.2.0_535.54.03_linux.run git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp cd llama.cpp Just the CPU rm -rf build cmake -B build -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF cmake --build build --config Release ./build/bin/llama-cli -hf Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M -p ""Explain quantum entanglement"" Result: It works! And Qwen3 is a reasoning model, so it takes a little time to answer. The result then is: pp 14.4 t/s and tg 4.9 t/s. Does the benchmark work with b8157? ./build/bin/llama-bench -m ~/.cache/llama.cpp/Qwen_Qwen3-4B-GGUF_Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf Result: pp512 with 18.6 t/s and tg128 with 6.5 t/s. Now let’s try this with GPU: GPU with CUDA Compiler 12.2 cmake -B build -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGGML_CUDA=ON cmake --build build --config Release ./build/bin/llama-cli -hf Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M -p ""Explain quantum entanglement"" --n-gpu-layers 99 It worked! The work is distributed across all 4 GPUS. Now for benchmarking, with standard parameters I get pp512 813 t/s and tg128 40.3 t/s. Compared to CPU that’s 44x and 6.2x. If I limit to one GPU with UDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build/bin/llama-bench -m ~/.cache/llama.cpp/Qwen_Qwen3-4B-GGUF_Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 99 I get pp512 914 t/s and tg128 49 t/s. That’s 49x and 7.6x. Now to the benchmark to compare with the DGX Spark: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build/bin/llama-bench -m ~/.cache/llama.cpp/Qwen_Qwen3-4B-GGUF_Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 99 -p 4096 -n 8192 The result: pp4096 tg8192 GPU wall DGX 1970 61.8 65 W 150 W GPU 4x 698 21.54 240 W 440 W GPU 1x 664 23.47 175 W 304 W As mentioned above: 29x cheaper , using 2x the power and 2.5 to 3x slower. But with this token generation speed it is still usable. Not working with CUDA Compiler 12.9 I tried a freshly compiled llama.cpp b8134 with nvidia-smi 535.288.01 and nvcc 12.9. I thought it would be simple: rm -rf build cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=OFF -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS= ""--generate-code=arch=compute_61,code=sm_61 -Wno-deprecated-gpu-targets"" cmake --build build --config Release Testing ./build/bin/llama-cli -hf Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M -p ""Explain quantum entanglement"" --n-gpu-layers 99 No, it crashes.

The original Raspberry Pi 1 was running as a video player for a small 5” monitor, connected to its yellow coax video cable. No audio, but it worked! Later revisions of the Pi1 had this port removed. Hardware Finally a SoC with 64 bit! It took a while until the Raspberry Pi Holdings released a stable 64bit version of the operating system - May 2020. Officially only on 2 February 2022 was Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit released. CPU BCM2837 Cortex A53 This is the same CPU as in my Nvidia Jetson Nano. Being one of the first CPUs implementing the ARMv8-A 64-bit instruction set it left room for optimization and acceleration for later designs like the A72 cores. But 64-bit was supported, and the software had something to work with - each step of the stack takes time. It’s still running fine in 2026, some 10 years after the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 3. 2024-02-12 Benchmark After waiting on the shelf for several years I reactivated the Pi to see what it’s capable of. The results are part of my benchmark repository now. It also has some graphs. Good to see that the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB RAM has not only more RAM, but is measurably faster with the more modern Cortex-A72 cores. 2024 Home Assistant After resting for a while I installed Home Assistant on the machine.

But it only progressed to a few small sketches on paper, and the purchase of a 10m long “endless” paper roll to make a physical long version. It’s one of my long term My Projects . v0.1 First digital version in August 2006 In August 2006 I created several large HTML files with linked articles about the persons in this timeline. One version is 30,000 pixels wide! Read more about the history at https://kreier.github.io/timeline/history/ . Paper version as a book 2008 In 2008 I got “ Knaur’s Zeittafel der Weltgeschichte - Den letzten 6000 Jahren auf der Spur ” with a total length of 7 meters. It is so large that it takes considerable space to open and access the information. As far as I can tell it is a German translation of Adams Synchronological Chart or Map of History from 1871 (more than 150 years ago). In wikimedia is a scan of 40445x4309 pixel of this masterpiece. And there you would find a link to the 700 Megapixel JPEG 2000 scan file. Here are links to the two German editions at amazon.de . v1.0 Second digital version in February 2009 I soon realized that the large size of the “Zeittafel” allows it to have a lot of information. But it is also its weakness - it is just too large to comprehend. Or to view at a glance. No matter how large you make it, you can’t put in all the information you want. There is always something more to study, discover and integrate. So I started with a target size decision first: Three landscape A4 papers should contain the last 6000 years. This automatically determines the resolution. My first approach was a spreadsheet. And because I want it to be easily available, I chose to use OpenOffice 3.0 and the ODS format. I created the file on February 10th, 2009 with 3 tabs for the time 4050-1450 BCE, 1550 BCE - 150 CE and 150-2050 CE. All are designed to fit on a A4 paper, so these 3 pages can be glued together for a single timeline spanning 6000 years. 4050 - 1450 BCE For these 2600 years I chose a resolution of 10 years . The spreadsheet has 260 columns , but for the long periods of this time it is precise enough. 1550 BCE - 150 CE The resolution of only 10 years makes it difficult to visualize shorter time periods like the 2 years that Pekachja ruled Israel from 780-778 BCE or the one year that Ahasja ruled Judah 907-906 BCE. The second tile therefore is divided into columns for 5 years and needs 340 columns for the 1700 years from 1550 BCE to 150 CE. 130 BCE - 2050 CE The third tile went back to 10 years per column and needs 218 columns. It was never finished. v2.0 Creating a Vector Image with .odg in October 2015 The use of a spreadsheet really limits the possible resolution of the final product, being digital or a printed pdf. Here is a comparison of the resolution of my various approaches: page begin end timespan width/mm years/mm resolution columns created table 1 -4050 -1450 2600 277 9.39 10 260 2009-02-10 table 2 -1550 150 1700 277 6.14 5 340 2009-02-10 table 3 -130 2050 2180 277 7.87 10 218 2009-02-10 drawing odg -4000 2000 6000 1250 4.8 ∞ ∞ 2015-12-13 reportlab python -4050 2050 6100 1168 5.22 ∞ ∞ 2023-10-17 As next step I started to create a vector image that could be exported as pdf with the ability to zoom into details. On October 12, 2015 I started a LibreOffice 4.4 Drawing ODG with a scale of 1cm for 50 years or 5 years/millimeter, resulting in a document with the dimensions 1250x297 mm. This could be printed on my endless A4 paper roll. Last export as pdf on December 13, 2015. v1.1 Translation of v1.0 to English in June 2023 The original files from 2009 were created in German. Starting summer 2017 most of my life was going on in English. When sharing this project with friends in early June 2023 I promised to have the translated version ready until the end of month. And the translation was inded completed by June 30th, 2023. Some black/white copies were print out and shared for feedback. Yet the back of my mind was thinking of an elegant way to make v2.0 come to life. v3.0 Creation of an vector based version with python and reportlab in October 2023 After starting to write programs in python in 2018 and teaching it from 2022 on this looked like a good project to apply these skills. Reading values from a .csv data file would make the creation process much easier and structured. In early October 2023 I finally got reportlab working with python on both macOS and a WSL installation on Windows 11. The first step was to recreate the two pages from libreoffice with this new method. The targeted size is now 4 pages of A4 in landscape combined. This could be printed with the poster function or given to a professional printer to be released on one A0 paper and creating 4 timelines. The current edition is v3.5. Early October I wrote “Hopefully by end of October 2023 this is done.” That might be true for the initial edition, but the more you work with the document, the more ideas you get. See the growing content from v3.0 in October to v3.5 in November 2023: Since v3.4 it is also translated to German, with v3.5 a Vietnamese translation was added. And the respective translations have to be extended with each new detail added. The latest addition above includes the king of the North and South from Daniel 11. v4.0 Increase of version number to reflect the year in January 2024 To reflect the year of the timeline edition for at least the next 6 years I simply use the last digit of the year as the leading version indicator. In 2030 this might change to a two-digit version number, if I’m still working on this project. Here we start with v4.0 from January 2024 with extended language and script support: v4.7 Switch from reportlab to fpdf2 im May 2024 For 8 months I have been using the reportlab library in python to create the pdf files with the timeline. With a good documentation and support for utf-8 we were able to create the documents with embedded pixel and vector graphics. But by May 2024 I reached a limit of this package: the support for Text Shaping, especially the Glyph substitution is not implemented yet. The challenge is known for some time, but it requires significant manpower to implement properly. I documented my findings in issue #35 . I tried other solutions like: fpdf as Free PDF in PHP on github since 2015, but started in 2001 by Olivier Plathey - currently at version 1.86 pdfkit library for Node.js in the browser, on Github with 756 comits and 9600 stars, 16 releases since 2014, latest 0.15.0 from March 2024 PyMuPDF for data extraction and more, on Github with 2399 commits and 4300 stars, 144 releases since 2015, latest 1.24.4 from May 2024 weasyprint mainly to convert HTML to PDF, a professional product with good documentation on Github with 5548 commits and 6700 stars, 71 releases since 2016, latest v62.1 from May 2024 - yet as font subsetter Harfbuzz is currently experimental iText Core with pdfCalligraph as add-on for fonts like Arabic, Hebrew or Khmer, in Java; on Github with 6246 commits and 1900 stars, 41 releases since 2016, latest 8.0.4 Community from April 2024 reportlab with sourcecode mirrored on Github - all the way back to 2000 with version 0.85, 2.0 in 2006, 3.0 in 2014 and currently at 4.2.1 Interestingly, fpdf2 itself is a fork from PyPDF from reingart/pypdf 2016, itself being a fork of the fpdf library by Max Pat in 2006. See a little history . The release history indicates that Text Shaping was only introduced with 2.7.5 in August 2023. Now with 1479 commits and 969 stars, 33 releases since 2021, the latest being 2.7.9 from May 2024. v5.1 with more history from January 2025 I have to describe some of the changes here. v6.01 Extends family trees from Terah, Noah and Cain in January 2026 The family tree from Terah was already included in 2024. In 2025 it was extended to Noah to have 20 nations related to their origin or later offspring. With the new January edition of 2026, labeled v6.01 (in a system year.month) this also includes the known part of Cain’s family. There is little known of the people before the Great Deluge. New start with python and pdf in 2023 After a few days of work, spanned over a few months, it had grown to something with a lot more information than previous editions: Graph View Table of Contents v0.1 First digital version in August 2006 Paper version as a book 2008 v1.0 Second digital version in February 2009 4050 - 1450 BCE 1550 BCE - 150 CE 130 BCE - 2050 CE v2.0 Creating a Vector Image with .odg in October 2015 v1.1 Translation of v1.0 to English in June 2023 v3.0 Creation of an vector based version with python and reportlab in October 2023 v4.0 Increase of version number to reflect the year in January 2024 v4.7 Switch from reportlab to fpdf2 im May 2024 v5.1 with more history from January 2025 v6.01 Extends family trees from Terah, Noah and Cain in January 2026 New start with python and pdf in 2023 Backlinks 2023 2026 My Diary My Projects Created with Quartz v4.5.2 © 2026 GitHub Discord Community"

We’re both in Vietnam since 2016, but never actually met. With the exeption of a coincidence in Quy Nhon in August 2025. Hanoi and Saigon are far away and we have limited time to visit each others cities. Minh’s family is still in Hanoi, but leaving for Nha Trang from the airport at 2:00 PM. With a better helmet I pick her up at her sisters house, and we start the journey to Hà Giang. With leaving 2:00 pm from the airport we might be in Lũng Cú at 11:00 pm, if there are no stops, good streets etc. Well, it will take significantly longer, but we’ll make it safe. One hour in hour journey and out of Hà Nội the rain finally stops. It get’s dark at 5:30, and we continue until 9:00 PM. Some 150 kilometers are still to go to and continue to Should we stop for a little Pho or Com? No, we continue into the mountains. Refill the gasoline one last time, since the stations will close at 10:00 PM and we still have a long way to go. Since it is dark, foggy, unknown meandering mountain roads up to 1400 meters and no one else on the road it takes a little longer, but we arrive save at 3:00 AM in Lũng Cú. Nhung is awake and makes us a Ginger tea to welcome us. I get a new name: Thiên Sứ, since we did not eat or drink anything for 12 hours! 11-03 Monday, Phố Cổ, Đồng Văn 39.1 km Trip to the flag pole. 54 square meteres (6x9 meters) represents the 54 local minorities and etnicities in Vietnam. The afternoon we travel to the historic market in Đồng Văn. It has some great photo spots again. 11-04 Cốc Pảng and Du Gia Panorama Ecolodge 114.9 km On the way to Cốc Pảng Minh and I hike to a little overhanging rock next to the road for nice pictures, that other tourists took as well. The afternoon is for pictures in the gorge of Cốc Pảng. Ngoc and Cuong get some impressive wedding pictures taken. The story of their photographer is not less impressive. One includes a bicycle journey to China for a week and the return with a black inflatable boat over the river. Of course picked up at the factory in China itself, giving a tour of the facilities. Connected prior to this journey with Aliexpress. 11-05 Leaving the mountains, Hà Giang to Vinh 614.8 km Sunrice pictures of the valley in front of the Du Gia Panorama Ecolodge, and having good and bad roads to breakfast Banh Cuon, where I have to leave for the road. The others will catch a plane later the day. 11-06 Approaching Typhoon Kalmaegi, stopping in Quảng Ngãi 636.1 km The warning of the Tyhoon pops up in Google Maps, and from Hue on it starts to rain, never to stop. Some streets in Danang are already flooded. At about 8:00 PM the gas stations are closed near Quảng Ngãi. All shops are closed, the streets are empty and deserted. Many hotels are closed as well, storefronts are packed for storm and rain. I have to stop a little earlier, but its probably better and safer. 11-07 Journey through storm damage territory, back to Saigon 822.4 km At 6:00 AM the streets are busy again, the sun is slowly rising and with no rain will dry my soaked clothes in just 30 minutes on the road. Yet some streets have fallen trees from left to right. For hours it is a journey through storm damage territory. Roofs are missing, advertisement boards are toppled over, power lines and telephone lines. Some streets have all planted trees lying on the street. Near Quy Nhon it is damage whereever one looks. They are out of water for a day, and electricity in parts of the city will need another 3 days. At almost midnight I arrive back in district 7. It’s been 5275.5 kilometers! 11-08 Circuit assembly on Saturday I made it back in time, so I can attend the English circuit assembly on the weekend. Yay! In a Google sheet I noted the distance traveled with my bike each day since leaving Saigon on October 24. The first day was already a record day with over 600 kilometer on the motorbike on a single day! And November 7th is probably at the limit of what’s possible with over 800 kilometers.

I found a cheap place to stay for two nights, since Monday was reserved for my first day of study, and I wanted to have a place to return to in the evening. Yet Tuesday I could be back on the road to another journey, or extend my stay. Planning started Monday afternoon. 10-27 First day of study - Hà Nội 30.1 km It Monday, the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City ( Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh ) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam ( Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam ). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are still in China and are waiting for their visa. 10-28 Trip to Lào Cai , China and Sapa 369.9 km I arrived in Lào Cai at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit the train station and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. 10-29 Fansipan 21.1 km It is a sunny day, as predicted on Monday. 10-30 Return to Hà Nội 385.4 km Nhung’s family invited me to stay at their place. Immediately I was involved with the family, no time to “just leave” for the English meeting, or visit the central congregation 10-31 Wedding of Thai and Tram 0 km Nhung’s sister is taking us to the KH with her car, so we’re not bothered by the rain. Dỉnh has an encouraging talk for the new couple. After that we enjoy the company of all the guests with some good food. 11-01 Wedding part II in Hung Yen 50 km It’s slightly raining again on this Satuday. The second wedding part at Thai’s parents house is supposed to start at 11:00 AM. Trâm sent a message that we should start earlier in the North, at 10:00 AM. But we can already arrive at 9:00 AM, which we do. And the party is already in full swing! Actually it is the third part, since the first party was in Nha Trang earlier this week at the house of Trâm’s parents. The guests enjoyed the two days there very much, see the reel on Jesse’s Instagram account! The afternoon we went to Thai and Trâm’s apartment, rested a little, joined the Phan Thiet congregation over zoom and then had a good time together. For a few months there is a Hmong group in Hanoi, and it has 13 publishers - one brother, 12 sisters. Three of these young sisters are with us and share some encouraging experiences of their bible students. Our Ha Giang group is leaving this evening with the bus. I stay another night in Hanoi and will pick up Minh at the airport the next day. That’s the plan, anyways. 11-02 Finally meeting Markus I live in Vietnam since 2016, as does Markus. How is it, that we only meet by chance in August 2025 in Quy Nhon? Well, Hanoi and Saigon are far apart. We don’t travel to either city very often. This morning we have a coffee together at asdf near the Hồ Hoàn Kiếm . I can drive my bike through the store to the backyard, and we head for the third floor. Nine years in Vietnam gave us a lot of things to talk about. We figured out that in fall of 2010 we were at the same time in the Bethel in Selters, Germany. But with more than 1000 people around us we did not notice one another. It got a little later, since I had lunch at Nhung’s sisters house. But Minh had to pick up a better helmet at her sisters house, so we would meet there. Planned departure time: about 3:00 om.

Right thereafter a group wanted to do a tour of the Hà Giang loop. So I planned to go to Hanoi by bike and have my own motorbike available in the mountains. Events leading up to this journey made it all a little more time constrained. 09-25 Leave Vietnam for a Visa? In early September it was finally decided that my course as “Culture of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Language” was accepted at the University of Education HCM. A welcoming ceremony was held on September 21st. In order to get my 1 year visa I have to leave Vietnam and receive it abroad. I would leave on September 25th, but the procedure needs 6 working days, and I would have to stay outside the country to wait for the invitation letter. Since a trip to Can Tho (Half marathon on September 14th) was planned for October 3rd to 6th, I postponed the trip to Cambodia. 10-07 Cambodia until October 20th I left Vietnam as indicated on October 7th, but my application was only submitted on October 8th. While it was processed in Vietnam, I had to wait in Phnom Penh to finally get the invitation letter. On Thursday, October 16th it finally arrived. I went to the embassy, and it is only 145 USD if you wait 5 working days. Waiting 3 working days and you pay 160 USD. Or get it the same day for 205 USD. So I waited 3 working days (Thursday, Friday and Monday) to get the visa finally on Monday, October 20th. Time to return to Vietnam, start registration etc. 10-24 Saigon - Măng Đen 624.1 km I started on this Friday early in the morning to avoid the rush hour in Ho Chi Minh City. Before lunch I was already in Gia Nghia, and shortly thereafter in Buon Ma Thuot. With sunshine I continued to Pleiku, Kon Tum and had the first raindrops after sunset closer to Mang Den. 10-25 Huế 420.2 km It started raining in Măng Đen and only got more intense, the further north I drove. I had the mountain road in better memory. Yet the first 140 kilometers to Bắc Trà My (near Đập Thủy Điện Sông Tranh 2) were alternating between older concrete roads and asphalt roads with potholes. On two occasions the road was swept away with a landslide from the rainfalls of previous days. And since it kept raining the whole day, it included a mud river crossing the street, that had me loose my flipflops while trying to cross the street there. The next 108 km from Bắc Trà My to tt. Thạnh Mỹ, crossing the Hiệp Hòa Tunnel, were slightly better. For brief moments, the rain stopped, and one could enjoy the mountain panorama and meandering streets. Arriving in Thạnh Mỹ, the rain had stopped and I was ready for lunch. For the next leg I chose the coastal road. And getting closer to Danang it started raining again, and did not stop even until 150 milometers late until 5:30 PM in Huế. So I got a bed in a Nhà Nghỉ and prepared for the Saturday evening zoom meeting. 10-26 Hà Nội 650.4 km It kept raining in the morning until around lunch time or 373 km later, when I arrived in Vinh. Then it stopped, and I could dry in the wind while finishing the 3-day trip to Hanoi.

And so the improved Jupyter notebook format from 2011 with Python support resembles his original pursuit. Local vault - static version I The vault I use is the content folder inside my quartz repository. The updated content is found on kreier.github.io/quartz . This is rendered each time I push a commit to the repository, running with GitHub Actions. Static version II at saiht.de/obsidian and diary.saiht.de There is also a second static version, that needs to be generated with node.js on my hp mini 400 G9 i7-13700T. The steps are: Create an updated static site version with npx quartz build --serve Check it on http://localhost:8080 Upload the content of the public folder with FileZilla Update Quartz Sometimes there are some updates in Quartz that should be included in the obsidian repository. Here are the 3 steps from the command line: npx quartz update npx quartz sync npx quartz build --serve The first checks for updates in Quartz and downloads updates to the codebase from the original source the Quartz repository was cloned from. The second makes a Github push for edits to the personalized copy with content in the /content folder. And the third one actually starts the quartz web server and creates the static website under /public and serves it at http://localhost:8080 to investigate Statistics of this Obsidian vault Some first steps with Obsidian date back to First use of Obsidian , but I actually started the current version in combination with Quartz 4.0 on October 27th, 2025 with Official start of my study at Su Pham and Extension of a few projects on my first day of study while being in Hanoi.

It is partly inspired by Github itself. It gives a nice graphical overview of the contribution frequency for a period of a year, including each day. For example, 8 years at Github look like this: Could I extend this for my diary and my whole life? The repository statistics-diary does exactly that. There is still a lot of work to do.

Hiking It’s a rather common leisure time activity in Germany, or Europe in general, to go on a hike on weekends or on vacations. We found old pictures of my parents taking me and my siblings on a hike during summer vacations in the southern mountains of East Germany in the early 80s. Chechia The neighbouring country Chechia offers great hiking trails in the so called “Sächsische Schweiz”. In the 90s you could take a “Schönes Wochenende Ticket” (beautiful weekend ticket) of the Deutsche Bahn (Germain railroad) for just 7.50 Euro to travel all trains inside the country with 5 friends for 2 days. And the last train just stops at a station on the Elbe river on the other side of Chechia, it’s just a ferry ride away and you’re in a different country! We used this opportunity many times to enjoy nature and upbuilding company with friends on weekend trips there. Vietnam The hiking nature is not yet as developed as in Europe or America, but constantly improving. A few hikes I took: Núi Dinh near Vũng Tàu, some 450 meters high and 2h25 away from Hoof Chis Minh City.

And of course include some travel stories . As of 2026/01/01 this vault has 91 files with a total of 38831 words that would take 2h26 to read. Here are a few highlights from the 5 categories: My Projects My life is filled with unfinished projects and new ideas, that I continue to start pursuing. Documenting and organizing these projects, maybe even to finish them, is just another project. On GitHub I started projects in 2018, and by 2020 there were already 35 projects. At the end of 2025 this has grown to more than 170 repositories, with some (like timeline ) having hundreds of commits. As of December 22nd, 2025, only 3 projects are documented in this vault. My Websites 1999-2026 Technically this is another project. Or rather, projects. Over the last 27 years I had several websites. Then finally in 2025 I simplified these projects and combined them into one contract. Since 2026 I have only 3 websites left: saiht.de since 1999, my personal page, some details in this vault at saiht.de kreier.org since 2018, my page for professional things, details in this vault at kreier.org people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/ since 2000, my page related to my study of physics at the Humboldt Universität von Berlin , see (to be completed) More details are listed and linked in the My Websites page. And for each site I made a separate history page: saiht.de 1999-2025, kreier.org, people.physik.hu/berlin.de/~kreier/, saiht.org, hofkoh.de, stemfair.org, mypdesign.org, lacy.de, saiht.net (2002-2004). Travel history It is good from time to time to reflect on the good things one received in life. That is certainly true for journeys to remote places and time with friends. Both the travel itself as time remembering can fill us with gratitude. Documenting my travels was already a part of my first edition of saiht.de in 1999. For the trip to Asia in 1998 I bought a book with black pages, since the contrast to the images let them appear more vibrant. A lot has happened since then. About the blog Not everything is a project , or belongs to the travel category. But it’s worth remembering, to reflect on one’s course in life. So I write down some notes about it. In 2008 I started a blog on saiht.de/blog and had 97 entries until the end of 2025. With Obsidian I copied some stories over, translated them, expanded them and continued to document pieces of my life. My Diary I started a diary several times both physical on paper and digital in many different software solutions and platforms (OneNote, Google Docs, Apple Notes and Journal, Markdown, GitHub, Website) that is scattered around. Here I try to consolidate these all into my Obsidian vault and store it in the Markdown format with GitHub backup. That’s my plan in 2025, at least. In a few years I will look back. In November 2025 I have some notes for 2025 , 2024 and 2023 . A part of my diary is also the story of Leisure activities and places I have been Working and Living . Statistics With several digital places for information, and countless paper documents and other artifacts one might wonder: “How extensive is this project?” Well, I have some answers. History On November 21st, 2024, I started to use Obsidian to organize and collect my thoughts, while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It took until one other visit in October 2025 to get it synced to GitHub and published on GitHub with Quartz 4.5.2 and on saiht.de/obsidian . Footnotes This is a blank Quartz installation. See the documentation for how to get started. And one thing I like is the support for LaTeX, like this Noether current. j μ = i = 1 ∑ N ​ δ ( ∂ μ ​ ϕ i ​ ) δ L ​ φ i ​ , φ i ​ := ∂ α ∂ ϕ i ​ ​ ​ α = 0 ​ Of course it fulfils the Continuity equation . It is taken from my Wikipedia page in German, where I contribute since 2006.

Some details of the history and progress are written on the Timeline page. 2016 2016-2017 Treehouse in Saigon at the International German School Ho Chi Minh City. The school moved to a new location in 2025, so this is a past project. See Treehouse in Saigon . 2013 2013-2016 Treehouse in Hofkoh. This was fun, even my students from Scheeßel came to visit to have their part in building it! Unfortunately the storm in October 2025 was too strong for the old willow tree, so it crashed.
