About Hofkoh Saigon History of course 615 Written by Matthias in Saigon , Study Since May 16th, 2024, I try to study at the Su Pham university. The requirement in 2024 was to have at least 15 students to get this course started, even though it was intended for 20 students. By June 17th I had submitted my application, but still had to wait for a response in September, when the new semester starts September 2024 – not enough students After Independence Day of Vietnam (September 2nd) I finally got an answer on September 5th: We are only 7 students, far from the required 15 students. So this year the course Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hoá Việt Nam will not start. Maybe after TET 2025? In January 2025 we indeed got an email, but it was only directed to 5 people. The course will not start in the summer semester, so we will have to wait for the winter semester in September 2025. July 2025 – Hope from Dr. Tâm I had already contacted Mrs. Tâm on March 11th, and we had a short phone converstion. She wanted to organize study sessions over zoom, but got no permission from administration. A renewed conversation on July 7th from Núi Dinh lead to a personal meeting at the Su Pham university on Junly 8th. And this gave me new hope, the requirements by the administration are lowered to just 10 people! I prepared the documents. After the health check on July 25th I finally submitted all documents on July 30th. With just one day left until the deadline for any application it is frightening to know that we have only 3 applicants so far! September 2025 – we are at go! My inquiry on September 3rd lead to the responso to please wait a little longer. So I visited on September 15th, and got a great message: The course will start! At the end of the week, on Friday September 19th, I got an email with the now 4 students that would start this bachelor course in the K51 kohort. It’s the 51st year since the university was founded in 1975. More history would follow in December. But first, the enrollement with 400 other students on September 21st: Yes, when they talk about foreign students, they do look at me. Even though one other student is present, but since he is from China, he looks to Asian to stick out. The two other students from China and Korea are not yet in Vietnam. October 2025 – Three more students from Laos and China My student numbers is 51.01.615.002. The 51 stands for 51st kohort, 01 for regular student (not doctorate or higher), 615 for my course at the foreign languages faculty and I’m the second student. By the end of September we all payed, and I have to spent 2 weeks in Cambodia to get my visa. The application process at the immigration office in Saigon can’t be started unless I’m outside Vietnam, so I drive to Cambodia on October 7th and the application is submitted on October 8th. On October 16th my invitation letter is finally there! You can get the visa at the embassy in Phnom Penh on this very day, but with some extra fee of 205 USD. If you wait 3 working days (until Monday next week, October 20th) it is only 160 days. And if you can wait 5 working days, it’s only 145 USD. Compared to my expenses in PP it makes sense to wait the extra days until Monday. And I get a lot of stuff done in the coffee shops in this time. We officially start on October 27th, 5 weeks after the welcome ceremony on September 21st. But I’m in Hanoi for a wedding, and two more students are still in China. So we meet virtually on Google Meet – that does not work in China. We figure out, that Zoom does not work either. But Dr. Tâm is welcoming us all and giving us the important information we need. Two weeks later, on November 10th, I’m finally in class in person! Time to learn Vietnamese, with 7 weeks delay. To catch up will take some time. But we’re still not complete! One week later our department postpones the celebration of Teachers day from Thursday, November 20th to Tuesday, November 18th. Now we have at least a group picture of 6 of us in the auditorium with 600 Vietnamese students: 6 students on November 18th in the auditorium Read more about it at Teacher day in Vietnam . One day later (November 19th) we’re finally complete! So what is the history of course 615 – Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn hoá Việt Nam ? A conversation with Mrs. Tâm on Friday, December 19th, gives me further insight. Course 615 in the past When we open our book 1 and 2, we see that the printing was ordered 1000 copies of book 1 in 2016 (with two different editions in our class) and 500 copies of book 2 in 2015. This is at least the second iteration, only book 4 should still be very old. In the years prior to Covid-19 many students from Korea attended the university to learn Vietnamese. Their parents worked at companies in Saigon, and large classes of up to 35 students learned more about the Vietnamese language and culture of Vietnam. Another group signing up for university were students from Afrika. One student was also signing up his sister, father, mother and aunt. For about 1000 USD each got a one year multi entry visa for Vietnam that would otherwise be more expensive or not attainable. But the immigration office had already started to crack down on this practice and required the students to actually show up to class, not just on day one. This “loophole” was already fixed in the 2010s. But with all the restrictions during the pandemic time the class K45 (2019-2023) had to start studying online in 2020. With the uncertainty K46 was not started in 2020. While the situation was rather safe in Vietnam, international travel would not have foreigners enter the country, and K45 had already returned home. In early 2021 Saigon was severly affected by the Omicron variant. And while vaccinations were slowly rolling out in summer, the city went into lockdown from June to August 2021. Many were stuck in Phu Quoc, and three months of only virtual activity meant that there was also no K47. The numbers then never returned to normal. Currently K48 and K49 have only 2 students, so these 4 students learn together now. Name of the Class Years of Study Number of Students Minimum number of St. K45 2019-2023 35 K46 2020-2024 – K47 2021-2025 – K48 2022-2026 2 ? K49 2023-2027 2 ? K50 2024-2028 0 15 K51 2025-2029 7 10 Yet without students the ministry of education would eventually delete course 615. This assessment is done every 3 years. Two very low student years and one year without students meant to lower the requirement to just 10 students for K51 – and even that could not be met. Well, we are at least 7 students, and for the second semester we might get some exchange students from Taiwan. So far this course is still alive. Let’s see what happens next year. And if we can finish our bachelor. study Su Pham ← Reactivation 2025 Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

https://saiht.de/blog/2025/10/19/12-years-down-four-more-years-to-go/,"12 years down – four more years to go – Stay Curious. Stay Curious. About Hofkoh Saigon 12 years down – four more years to go Written by Matthias in Saigon , Study It’s puzzling to realize how much time I spent to get an education. By 2025 I used 12 years of my life to get professional training, in addition to my 10 years of regular school attendance. That’s right, I don’t have a high school diploma (Abitur in Germany). But I taught high school kids and helped them improve their grades. Kommunikationselektroniker – 3 years My first professional education is from vocational training at the Deutsche Telekom AG , Niederlassung Potsdam on the Telegrafenberg. It usually requires 3.5 years, but I could shorten it with 4 other students to just 3 years. The official description is Kommunikationseletroniker Fachrichtung Fernmeldetechnik (communication electronics technician, specialized in telecommunication). Diplom-Physiker – 7.5 years I started to study physics at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin in 2000. This is before the bachelor and masters degree were introduced in Europe following the Bologna process . The diploma I received is now considered equal to a masters degree . The regular study time (Regelstudienzeit) for physiks is 5 years. But I spent 2 semester at the MSU – Moscow State University (МГУ Моско́вский госуда́рственный университе́т и́мени М. В. Ломоно́сова) in Russia. And I invested 1.5 years into the investigation of HgCdTe Narrow-Gap Semiconductors at the HU and BESSY (Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung mbH). The work is reflected in my diploma thesis “Elektronische Eigenschaften von CdxHg1-xTe mit 0.07 < x < 0.4” ( here a link to the document on my personal university homepage ). The diploma system does not have a major and minor part. You are only required to study an additional subject for one semester. I chose physical chemistry (Physikalische Chemie) by Prof. Rademann in 2001 with a practice (many experiments and lab reports) over the summer break. This was really fun! This degree allowed me to teach Math, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science at public schools in Germany. In 2012 I finally decided to officially become a teacher and get a teaching license. Oberstufenlehrer für Mathematik und Physik im Niedersächsischen Schuldienst – 1.5 years Teachers in Germany study for a master of education at universities. But that is only the first step, therefore called Erstes Staatsexamen (first state exam). To qualify as a teacher you also need to pass your Zweites Staatsexamen (second state exam), which usually requires an additional 2 year training period called Referendariat with a teaching obligation of 10 hours per week and lectures at a specialized institute. I started my ‘Referendariat’ at the Studienseminar Stade in Lower Saxony. To save costs the state had reduced the training time to 1.5 years. While living in Hofkoh , I was travelling to the Studienseminar Lehramt an Gymnasien (45 kilometers), continued to the Gymnasium Warstade in Hemmoor (another 29 kilometers) and after a day of work with frequent visits to my lectures traveled the 56 kilometers back home on most days of the week. It was a stressful time 2012/08 – 2014/01. Above the start on August 1st, 2012; Mathe Leistungskurs 12 in Hemmoor 2013 and finally the graduation on January 19th, 2014. In summer 2015 at the Didacta I realized that there are more then 200 International German Schools around the world! It took a while to make up my mind and collect information, but in February 2016 I started applying for several schools around the globe. Here is the list until April 2016: Taiwan, Taipei China, Shanghai Pudong Egypt, Hurghada India, Mumbai Vietnam, Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City Indonesia, Jakarta Turkey (now Türkiye), Ankara Russia, Moscow I added my resume to the database. Offers from Belgium and Mexico reached me by email. Teaching in the English language – 5 years My teaching degree brought me to Saigon in Vietnam, but I only taught for 1 year in German. After that I worked 3 years for the American International School Vietnam and 2 years for the Saigon South International School . The topics span a variety of subjects and include the American curriculum, IB Diploma Program and AP Advanced Placement. For the IB and AP I received special training. Here is a list: IB Physics HL/SL (training in Jakarta) Chemistry Integrated Science 9/10 (biology, chemistry and physics) MYP Design (training in Bangkok) AP Physics A (training in Sacramento) High School Math AP CSP Computer Science Principles (training in Baltimore) Live Science Advanced Automation From a certain perspective I was successful with my teaching. In IB Physics at the AISVN we never had an SL student receive 6 points, and only one time in the past a student had received 6 points on HL higher level. No one ever got 7 points. I wanted to change that. My first 2-year course started in 2018, and the results of 2020 were remarkable. All 15 students passed, both SL and HL. And some students received 6 and 7 points as their IB score, both HL and SL. Usually the best subject at AISVN is IB Vietnamese Literature with an average slightly above 6 points, and for obvious reasons. But in 2020 the best subject was IB Physics HL with an average of 6.5 IB points ! Two students scored 6 points, two students scored 7 points. I am very proud of my students! AISVN was fun, see post on twitter/X : The work at SSIS was also both challenging and rewarding. In 2022-2023 I supervised 2 ASAs (after school activities): The SSIS Robotics club with VEX V5 and the game developer club Unity Impact . At the end of the year we also absorbed the remaining students of the Girls Code club into our Unity Impact club. The start for VEX was not easy, since I was completely new to the program. Until the end of 2022 no student could travel, so we could not take the students to the Signature Event in Taipei at the TAS to give them some experience in this competition. But early 2023 we set a new Vietnamese record for 12 attending teams from 5 schools at the Vietnam National Championship 2023 Spin Up. And for the first time we had a Middle School Team in Vietnam. Now there were 2 spots available to represent Vietnam at the World Championship in Dallas. And I was coaching both winning teams, so I could travel with both teams to the United States: We had a great time in Dallas. It was a nice experience for the students, they progressed so much in the coming years and returned to Dallas in 2025! Now it’s time for me to improve my Vietnamese. I have lived in this country for 9 years already! Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn hóa Việt Nam – 4 years I started applying for Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn hóa Việt Nam (Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam) at the Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh (Su Pham university) since May 2024, but the requirements to start this course were not met. The course is intended for 20 students, the university requires at least 15 students to sign up. By October 2024 we were only 7 Students. In 2025 the requirements were lowered to at least 10 students, but by the end of the signup period in July 2025 we were only 3 students. September 1st we were 4, and Ms. Tân could convince the board of directors to start the course anyway. It worked , we are now Tân Sinh Viên Khóa 51 of 7220101. My student ID is 51.01.615.002. The opening ceremony on September 21st was only attended by 2 of our students, the others were still in Korea and China. In October 2025 we have already 7 students ! I went to Cambodia for 2 weeks to get my 1-year visa. It will take 4 years to receive my bachelor degree (bằng cử nhân). The story continues until 2029. By then I will have spent 26 years as a student, almost 50% of my life! Preparation while in Cambodia Since October 2023 I enjoyed studying in the cafe on the ground floor of the RS II Guesthouse, Phnom Penh. It was named Coffee TodaY . But for 2 months it is already a new restaurant. The new restaurant is not yet on Google. And from outside it is difficult to see that you can enter the second floor and the A/C area. I figured it out on October 17th and spent the next 3 days there almost the whole time by myself. I got things done. Then I tried to publish this place on Google Maps. Let’s start with the name: SPECIALITY IN PORK – បាយ សាច់ជ្រូកជាតិ I have no idea how to enter Cambodian or Khmer characters with my keyboard. This was the first challenge. I took a picture and used internet services. The Wifi is named BAY SACH JRUK CHEAT while Google translate reads bay sach chrouk cheate for បាយ សាច់ជ្រូកជាតិ. Here is the explanation from ChatGPT: The Khmer phrase បាយ សាច់ជ្រូកជាតិ (bai sach chruk cheat) can be broken down like this: បាយ (bai) → rice (usually refers to cooked rice or a meal) សាច់ជ្រូក (sach chruk) → pork (literally “pig meat”) ជាតិ (cheat) → national , local , or domestic (as opposed to imported or foreign) So, បាយ សាច់ជ្រូកជាតិ means: 👉 Rice with local pork or Rice with domestic pork — essentially, “pork and rice made with local meat.” It could appear on a menu to emphasize that the pork is from Cambodia rather than imported. So, that’s ChaptGPT. Now it’s on Google Maps too. This is the place I wrote this post. And analyzed more than 1500 bank transactions from my old German bank account of the last 12 years. study Su Pham ← Gehen wir noch einen trinken?

Jetzt war ich endlich auch dort und habe ein 360°-Panorama geschossen. Einfach mit der Maus auf das Bild klicken und bewegen. Der Blick über den Strand war toll: Und das Wasser natürlich auch: Auf dem Rückweg fing es leider wieder an zu regnen. Auch bei 28°C besitzen die Regentropfen noch einiges an kinetischer Energie und Impuls, um beim Auftreffen aus 60 km/h deutlich spürbar zu sein. Ich nehme wieder die Fähre über den Nhà Bè Fluss (darin mündet der Saigon-Fluss) für 3000 VND (0,12 €) – jetzt allerdings in der Nacht. Ich habe eine Geschichte für jeden Tag zurück bis zu meiner Ankunft. Stück für Stück fülle ich die Tage auf – bitte etwas Geduld. Zum Teil beginne ich nur mit den Bildern.

About Hofkoh Saigon Bankkonto 3: BIDV und Vietin Written by Matthias in Saigon Nachdem die Kontoeröffnung bei der Standard Chartered gescheitert ist, versuche ich mich auf eigene Faust bei zwei vietnamesischen Banken. Die erste ist unsere Hausbank – die Bank für Investment und Development in Vietnam. Nachdem ich die Adresse in Distrikt 1 nahe dem höchsten Gebäude der Stadt (Bitexco-Tower) ausgemacht habe kann ich dort relativ schnell ein Konto eröffnen. Monatliche Kosten: 8800 VND (35 Cent) für den SMS-Service des Kontostandes. Aber es gibt Zinsen auf das Guthaben! Eine Debit-Mastercard kostet 66.000 VND (2,65€) also bestelle ich diese auch noch. Jede Überweisung kostet 6.600 VND (26 Cent). In einer Woche soll alles fertig sein. Es geht doch! Die größte Bank des Landes ist die Vietin Bank. Eine Filiale ist etwa 150m entfernt – also eröffne ich auch hier ein Konto. Die VISA debit card kostet monatlich 5.500 VND (22 Cent) und eine Überweisung 9.900 VND (40 Cent). Egal, um der Information willen ist es den Test wert. Denn bald stelle ich fest – die Webseite ist nachts oft nicht erreichbar. Aus Sicherheitsgründen? Dabei geht es gar nicht einmal um Überweisungen, allein der aktuelle Kontostand kann nicht abgerufen werden. BIDV ist übrigens kaum besser. Chrome meldet mir auf der Startseite 160 Warnungen im HTML-Code. Keiner meiner Browser zeigt die Seite korrekt an, weder Safari noch Edge noch Internet Explorer noch Chrome. Ich mache gar den Versuch, die Bank darauf hinzuweisen. Meist geht ohnehin nur alles auf Vietnamesisch, die Umschaltung auf Englisch ist entweder nicht vorhanden, nur rudimentär umgesetzt oder fehlerhaft. Zumindest im Moment. Denn hier ist viel Geld unterwegs, der Bankensektor wächst schnell – so ist auch hier die Abhilfe nur eine Frage der Zeit.

Schnell ein Blick unter die Sitzbank und es werden 1,75 bar vorn und hinten empfohlen. Also auf zur Tankstelle und Druck überprüfen. Nicht in Vietnam. Dort gibt es weder Kompressor noch Druckmessgerät. Ich fahre mehrere Tankstellen an – vergebens. Dann sehe ich am Straßenrand jemanden mit einem Kompressor, der auch Motorräder repariert. Er hat geraden einen neuen Mantel aufgezogen. Sein Kompressor hat auch ein Manometer und zeigt 6 bar an. Ich zeige also die gewünschten 1,75 bar beim Tankinnendeckel und weise auf sein Manometer hin. Er pumpt vorn etwas auf und schlägt mit dem Radmutternschlüssel gegen den Reifen. Ohne auf das Manometer zu schauen. Der Klang reicht. Und wie der Schlüssel zurückspringt. Dann pumpt er noch einmal nach. Das Hinterrad findet er nach dem “Schlagtest” gleich in Ordnung. 4000 VND bezahlt und der Reifendruck sollte stimmen. Zwei Wochen später kaufe ich für 97500 VND (3,95€) ein analoges Luftdruckmessgerät und stelle fest: Das Vorderrad hat 3,5 bar, das Hinterrad 1,2 bar. Beim Vermieter des Scooters passe ich den Luftdruck auf die vorgegebenen (und sinnvollen) Werte an. Schon fährt der Roller viel besser.

Stattdessen habe ich nur einen Vertrag über 11 Monate erhalten. Dabei ist das kostenlose Fahrrad zur Kontoeröffnung schon verlockend. Den Haken finde ich in den nächsten Wochen heraus. Man kann hier ein Fahrrad für 40€ kaufen! Was der Dame in der Bank übrigens nicht aufgefallen ist: Im Vertrag ist noch ein Anhang 2 als Bestandteil des Vertrages festgelegt. Danach hat sie gar nicht gefragt. Im Zweifelsfall wäre jener gar nicht unterschrieben gewesen. Und wenn wir gerade von Anhang 2 reden – wo ist dann Anhang 1? Das fiel dann noch ein paar Wochen später einer Angestellten einer anderen Bank auf. Nun, den habe ich gar nicht.

About Hofkoh Saigon Bankkonto 1: Standard Chartered Written by Matthias in Saigon Für meinen Arbeitsvertrag benötige ich ein vietnamesisches Konto, damit mir mein Gehalt in vietnamesischen Dong (VND) überwiesen werden kann. Sonst würde der Arbeitsvertrag nicht genehmigt werden. Natürlich ist er sowohl in deutsch als auch in vietnamesisch verfasst und umfasst einen 8-Stunden-Tag mit einstündiger Mittagspause. Das hat zwar mit dem Lehreralltag nix zu tun, ist aber Standard. Andere Verträge gibt es nicht. Keine kürzere Arbeitszeit, schon gar keine Teilzeit. Na gut, also ein Konto eröffnen. Nico sagte am Tag seiner Hochzeit, dass er einige Probleme mit der BIDV – der Vertragsbank der Schule – hatte, plus Verständigungsschwierigkeiten, und daher zur Standard Chartered Bank gewechselt ist. Als englische Bank sprechen sie ohnehin englisch, alles ist problemlos. Wir fahren also am Montag früh zur Standard Chartered und beantragen ein Konto. Während einige Vietnamesen warten werden wir sofort zu einem Beraterplatz weitergeführt. Die Sonderbehandlung der “Langnasen” wird uns hier noch öfter begegnen. Online hatte ich mich schon informiert und meinen Reisepass mit Visum für meinen neuen PowerSaver Account mitgebracht. Wir füllen das dreiseitige englische Antragsformular aus und erfahren erste Details: So einfach geht das nicht. Unser Reisepass muss erst ins Vietnamesische übersetzt und die Übersetzung beglaubigt werden. Ich frage ungläubig nach: Eine englische Bank will die englischen Angaben in meinem Reisepass ins vietnamesische übersetzen? Beglaubigt? Wozu? Nun, es ist wohl Gesetz und die Bank kümmert sich selbst um die Details. Also gut. Jetzt braucht die nette Bankangestellte noch mein Einkommen. Ich kann nämlich nicht einfach so Geld nach Deutschland überweisen. Für jeden Betrag, den ich überweise, muss klar sein, aus welcher Quelle das Geld stammt. Wie genau man das auseinanderhalten will ist mir nicht klar, aber wohl das Gesetz. Auch diese Angabe erhält sie, voraussichtlich wird dieser Betrag wohl in Zukunft ohnehin regelmäßig auf dem Konto landen. Nun brauchen wir auch noch den Arbeitsvertrag!!! Ich will doch nur ein Konto eröffnen! Nein, sie braucht den Vertrag, sonst können wir kein Bankkonto eröffnen. Das stand nicht auf der Internetseite. Ist ihr egal. Macht nix, ich habe ihn eingescannt und auf meinem Tablet dabei. Bitte sehr! Nein, den Arbeitsvertrag können wie so nicht annehmen. Was?? Er ist nicht auf jeder Seite gestempelt, sondern nur auf der 10. Seite. Das genügt nicht! Damit die Bank ihn akzeptiert muss jede Seite gestempelt sein. Ich verstehe es nicht. Für mich ist dieser Vertrag ausreichend und bindend, aber um ein Bankkonto zu eröffnen genügt er nicht. Wir müssen morgen wiederkommen, mit jeder gestempelten Seite! (Auf die Idee mit Photoshop komme ich zu spät) Leider geht es nicht anderes und wir vertagen uns auf morgen. Da wir schon mal unterwegs sind, fragen wir gleich noch bei der Vietcombank im gleichen Gebäude nach. Unserer Übersetzerin Dung wird erklärt, dass für sie dieselben Regeln gelten würden, es ist keine Schikane der einen Bank. So genervt wie wir sind glauben wir es immer noch nicht. Wir fahren also auch noch zur BIDV in die Stadt. In der großen Filiale bestätigen auch diese Mitarbeiter, dass es so umständlich ist. Was soll’s. Zurück in der Schule drucke ich meinen Vertrag möglichst klein und unleserlich aus, dann wird ein roter Stempel über die aufgefächerten Seiten gedrückt. Der rote Stempel ist hier SEHR WICHTIG.

Was sind Ladenschlusszeiten? Aber ohne religiöse Beeinflussung ist wohl weder der Sabbat (Samstag) noch der Sonntag heilig oder arbeitsfrei. Business as usual. Das steht übrigens im krassen Kontrast zu den Öffnungszeiten von öffentlichen Einrichtungen oder Banken: Zwischen 12:00 Uhr und 13:30 Uhr braucht man gar nicht versuchen, dort vorstellig zu werden. Da ist nämlich Mittagspause – und die scheint heilig zu sein. Dafür schließen sie aber auch schon um 16:30 Uhr. Sie können es sich wohl leisten.

About Hofkoh Saigon Nico’s Hochzeit Written by Matthias in Saigon Auch wenn die Überschrift mit einem Deppen-Apostroph beginnt, so bin ich doch innerhalb kürzester Zeit in das lokale soziale Leben integriert. Ein langjähriger Lehrer der IGS HCMC heiratet seine vietnamesische Freundin weitgehend traditionell und Dung Bui lädt mich ein, einfach mitzukommen. Nachdem wir bei Nicos Wohnung einige alte Freunde aus Deutschland und seinen Bruder abgeholt haben geht es zum Haus der Eltern der Braut. Hier wird auf die 7 Geschenke, die rituelle Übergabe, die Ehre der Urgroßeltern auf dem Hausaltar und weitere Details geachtet. Der weitere Verlauf ist zum Glück nicht so, wie in Vietnam üblich. Denn dann würden 100-500 Personen zum Essen eingeladen. Etwa von 12:00 bis 15:00 Uhr würden alle ein teures, aber nicht unbedingt wohlschmeckendes Mahl zu sich nehmen und dann nach Hause gehen. Nico freut sich hingegen auf etwas mehr Konversation mit Freunden und u.a. ein Video von Freunden, die nicht anwesend sein könne und die an seine Kindheit und verrückte Jugend erinnern. Die vietnamesische Verwandtschaft macht sich recht schnell aus dem Staub, die anderen sitzen bis 10:00 Uhr im Restaurant. Da wir dann unsere pädagogische Leiterin nach Hause bringen, beenden wir die Details an dieser Stelle 🙂 Kultur Vietnam ← neue Wohnung Shoppen am Sonntag → Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

About Hofkoh Saigon neue Wohnung Written by Matthias in Saigon Dank meines ausgeprägten Schlafdefizites höre ich keinen Wecker. Nach Inbetriebnahme der Wetterstation will ich mich nur kurz hinlegen und schlafe von 9:00 bis 14:00 Uhr durch. Damit bin ich bei der Wohnungsbesichtigung um 11:00 Uhr natürlich nicht dabei. Später erhalte ich aber ein paar Fotos per WhatsApp und bin um 17:00 Uhr noch einmal dort. Als Erstbezug im 17. Stock des Lexington vereinbaren wir 12.000.000 VND (480 €) monatlich für 48 m² Apartment mit Security im ganzen Haus und einer Zugangskarte, um überhaupt mit dem Fahrstuhl in den 17. Stock zu kommen. Ich wohne im Block hinten links. Das Fitnessstudio ist im dritten Stock. Den Pool im fünften Stock auf dem Dach von Block E kann man auch gut erkennen. Da macht die neue Apple Watch (weil wasserdicht) auch Sinn und ich habe eine Ausrede, sie mir kaufen zu müssen 🙂 Im Vergleich entspricht das wohl dem lokalen Niveau in Distrikt für eine möblierte Wohnung. Ohne Fitnessraum in eher vietnamesischer Umgebung ist wohl auch 8.000.000 VND möglich oder 6.500.000 unmöbliert. Dann fehlt aber vielleicht sogar die Klimaanlage. Einen Entwurf des Mietvertrages bekommen ich für das Wochenende einmal mit. Und wünsche mir einen größeren Fernseher (30 Zoll ist zu wenig) und einen Internetanschluss und eine Matratze für das Bett.

About Hofkoh Saigon Ankunft Ho Chi Minh City Written by Matthias in Saigon , Schule Nach Abflug aus Berlin am Mittwoch und kurzem Zwischenstop in Moskau und 10 Stunden Flugzeit lande ich am Donnerstag früh um kurz nach 9:00 Uhr in Ho Chi Minh City. Warme 28 °C erwarten mich und lassen sofort nach einem kurzen Ersatz für meine Jeans wünschen. Wie versprochen holt mich Bernd vom Flughafen ab. Mit dem klimatisierten Taxi geht es durch das Verkehrschaos der Stadt in Richtung Schule. Dabei erfahre ich schon mal einige Details zum besonders kreativen und chaotischen Leben in dieser Stadt. Nachdem die Sachen erst mal in der Schule untergestellt sind fahre ich auf dem Sozius von Bernds Roller zum Einkaufszentrum An Phu und zum Geldautomaten. Ich kann maximal 5.000.000 VND abheben, das mache ich zwei mal und bin somit ganz schnell Multimillionär! Schritt eins ist erledigt: Geld! Schritt zwei: Mobilfunk und Internet. Auf zum Laden des Vertrauens, die Karte kostet einmalig 45.000 VND (1,80 €). Für monatlich 90.000 VND (3,60 €) erhalte ich 1,2 GB Datenvolumen und einigen Aufladebonus. So habe ich ausreichend *102# Gesprächsguthaben und freie SMS. Für das iPad gibt es auch eine neue Karte: DC500 von viettel kostet 500.000 VND (20 €) einmalig und gibt mir für die folgenden 12 Monate 5GB Surfvolumen im 3G-Netz. LTE oder 4G wird in diesem Jahr erst aufgebaut, vielleicht kommt es nächstes Jahr mit hinzu. Dank Google Maps und GPS habe ich jetzt überall einen digitalen Stadtplan und Routenassistent dabei. Der dritte Schritt: Ein eigener Roller. Gut, das Fahren in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) ist speziell, dazu später mehr. Aufgrund der Rahmenbedingungen hier (Spritpreis, Wetter, rudimentäre öffentliche Verkehrsmittel) hat praktische jeder einen Roller und bewegt sich damit fort. Also fahren wir zum Händler des Vertrauens in Thao Dien. Ich miete einen Sym Attila Victoria mit 110 cm³ 8,6PS Variomatik und Durchschnittsverbrauch von 2,5 Liter/100km bei einem Spritpreis von 15390 VND (0,62 €) je Liter. Das macht 1,5 Eurocent pro Kilometer – das ist schwer zu unterbieten. Im Mietvertrag für einen Monat steht neben der Miete von 1.200.000 VND (48 €) ein Pfand von 4.000.000 VND (160 €) und regelmäßige Wartung, Reparatur und Pannenservice. Noch ein Helm für 220.000 VND (8,80 €) und ab 16:00 Uhr fahre ich allein durch die Stadt. Ernährungstechnisch bin ich noch nicht so ganz experimentierfreudig und begebe mich in ein McDonalds. Jene gibt es erst seit Anfang 2015 in HCM, doch sind schon ausreichend Filialen über die Stadt verteilt. Und KFC, BurgerKing, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts usw. fehlen natürlich nicht.

Schön wäre es, diese Wärmeenergie irgendwie nutzbar zu machen. Von Zeit zu Zeit wird dann der 200 Jahre alte Stirlingmotor als Lösung vorgeschlagen. Jene Wärmekraftmaschine wandelt tatsächlich Wärme wieder in mechanische Energie um. Wie sie funktioniert? Entweder in Wikipedia nachlesen oder ein Modell in China für 16€ bestellen und selbst ausprobieren: Leider wird immer wieder der geringe Wirkungsgrad dieser Maschine vergessen. Eine kurze Kalkulation von Aufwand und Nutzen beendet meist jenen Gedankenausflug. Trotzdem werden wohl Fakten und Meinungen weiterhin schön durcheinandergeworfen werden. Ich finde mein Modell schön.

Das Ergebnis hat Veritasium auf englisch einmal zusammengefasst: Will heißen: Man lernt aufgrund des sozialen Umfeldes, also einigen Gleichgesinnten (Gleichaltrigen) und einem Moderator (Lehrer). Das Medium oder die Art der Präsentation ist weit weniger wichtig. Ach ja, Veritasium beantwortet viele Fragen wie “ Ist Glas eine Flüssigkeit? ” oder “ Verursachen Handys Gehirntumore? ” oder “ Gibt es überhaupt eine von Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung ?” oder auch “ Ist man morgens leichter als abends? ” Sie gehen auch der Frage eines echten freien Willens nach, wenn doch alles um uns herum den Gesetzen der Natur folgt und jene berechenbar sind. Die Antwort hat mit Information, Entropie und Quantenmechanik zu tun 🙂 Aber Vorsicht: Mitunter liegt man mit seiner Antwort deutlich daneben . Nur ist das ja auch die Absicht von Derek Muller . Ein Ergebnis seiner Doktorarbeit war, dass man auf diese Weise den größten Lerneffekt erzielt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcX3IW00nuk Und falls es mal still ist: Hoffentlich werdet ihr nicht verrückt !

Da sich der Baum mit dem Haus so langsam etwas nach links neigte, wurde vorne links eine Stütze unter das Haus gebaut, um das zu verhindern.

Auch die alte Liste mit Kinofilmen habe ich aktualisiert, sie enthält jetzt 4000 Filme bis 2015: Datei als XLSX . Ganz will ich die Listen aber nicht vervollständigen. Das hat auch mit dem inflationären Anzahl von Serien zu tun, welches durch Eigenproduktionen von Netflix, Amazon und watchever noch beschleunigt wird.

Die Neuerung ist zwar ganz gut, aber nicht gut genug. Sie stürzt schwache Charaktere ins Verderben. Man wird ungefragt mit dieser Neuerung konfrontiert. Sie verändert unsere Denk-, Schreib- und Lesetechniken zum Schlechteren. Das passt zu der Idee, an unserer Schule für alle Schüler einer Jahrgangsstufe ein iPad einzuführen. Als Ersatz für die Schulbücher und den Grafischen Taschenrechner (GTR). Als Hilfsmittel zum Erstellen von Dokumentationen und Präsentationen. Als Nachschlagemittel mit Internetzugang.

Vor 1985 ist es allerdings recht dünn. Fernsehfilme sind natürlich ebensowenig enthalten wie Serien, Computerspiele, Handygames und Konsolenspiele. Listen dazu folgen später.

Für ein Dorf von 10 Häusern wäre es daher perfekt, alle Projektinfos über diese Seite abrufen zu können. Etwas Geschichte und weitere Projekte kann man dann ja im Laufe der Zeit ergänzen. Jetzt also läuft die Seite, hat auch eine MySQL-Datenbank, auf die WordPress zugreift. Wahrscheinlich ist das responsive Webdesign mit HTML5 auch automatisch geregelt. Alte Überlegungen werden eingescannt und zurückdatiert eingefügt, zukünftige Entwicklungen natürlich zeitnah mit Bildern dokumentiert. Was es mit dem Hausbauprojekt auf sich hat? 2010 erfuhr ich vom Solar Decathlon und dem Beitrag der Berliner Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft htw namens Living Equia . Jene habe ich auch besucht und mich mit den Studenten und Projektkoordinatoren unterhalten. Kosten des autarken Hausbauprojekts mit vielen Sponsoren: mehrere 100.000€. Also jenseits meines Budgets. 2012 ergab eine Überschlagsrechnung, dass ich mit Baumaterialien von Holz Haase für etwa 1200€ ein Minihäuschen von 12 Quadratmetern Grundfläche zusammenstellen könnte.

Seit 2005 bin ich dort registiert – neben 700.000 anderen Personen. Doch dank der neuen Sichtungsfunktion wurden meine Änderungen und Beiträge gelb hinterlegt, so als ob sie nicht vertrauenswürdig wären. Dabei sind zur Zeit nur 26.352 Personen aktiv. Und ich weiß doch genau, was ich schreibe. Also habe ich mich erst um die Frage der Sichterrechte gekümmert. Dazu benötigt man mindestens 300 Artikel-Edits, also Änderungen (auch Neuerstellung) von Artikeln. Private Seiten zählen nicht. Nach 2 Wochen hatte ich diese zusammen und wurde zu einem der 6538 Sichter befördert. Jetzt konnte ich selbst all meinen Arbeiten einen offiziellen Status geben. Wenig später stieß ich auf die Liste der ‘fleißigsten Wikipedianer’. Die Angabe ist nur relativ, denn manch einer ändert nur Anführungsstriche und Leerzeichen und erreicht damit einen enormen Edit-Wert. Hier ist die Liste: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Beitragszahlen Um in diese Liste zu gelangen, benötigt man 1000 Artikeledits und eine Eintragung auf der Opt-In Liste.
