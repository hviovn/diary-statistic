About Hofkoh Saigon History of course 615 Written by Matthias in Saigon , Study Since May 16th, 2024, I try to study at the Su Pham university. The requirement in 2024 was to have at least 15 students to get this course started, even though it was intended for 20 students. By June 17th I had submitted my application, but still had to wait for a response in September, when the new semester starts September 2024 – not enough students After Independence Day of Vietnam (September 2nd) I finally got an answer on September 5th: We are only 7 students, far from the required 15 students. So this year the course Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hoá Việt Nam will not start. Maybe after TET 2025? In January 2025 we indeed got an email, but it was only directed to 5 people. The course will not start in the summer semester, so we will have to wait for the winter semester in September 2025. July 2025 – Hope from Dr. Tâm I had already contacted Mrs. Tâm on March 11th, and we had a short phone converstion. She wanted to organize study sessions over zoom, but got no permission from administration. A renewed conversation on July 7th from Núi Dinh lead to a personal meeting at the Su Pham university on Junly 8th. And this gave me new hope, the requirements by the administration are lowered to just 10 people! I prepared the documents. After the health check on July 25th I finally submitted all documents on July 30th. With just one day left until the deadline for any application it is frightening to know that we have only 3 applicants so far! September 2025 – we are at go! My inquiry on September 3rd lead to the responso to please wait a little longer. So I visited on September 15th, and got a great message: The course will start! At the end of the week, on Friday September 19th, I got an email with the now 4 students that would start this bachelor course in the K51 kohort. It’s the 51st year since the university was founded in 1975. More history would follow in December. But first, the enrollement with 400 other students on September 21st: Yes, when they talk about foreign students, they do look at me. Even though one other student is present, but since he is from China, he looks to Asian to stick out. The two other students from China and Korea are not yet in Vietnam. October 2025 – Three more students from Laos and China My student numbers is 51.01.615.002. The 51 stands for 51st kohort, 01 for regular student (not doctorate or higher), 615 for my course at the foreign languages faculty and I’m the second student. By the end of September we all payed, and I have to spent 2 weeks in Cambodia to get my visa. The application process at the immigration office in Saigon can’t be started unless I’m outside Vietnam, so I drive to Cambodia on October 7th and the application is submitted on October 8th. On October 16th my invitation letter is finally there! You can get the visa at the embassy in Phnom Penh on this very day, but with some extra fee of 205 USD. If you wait 3 working days (until Monday next week, October 20th) it is only 160 days. And if you can wait 5 working days, it’s only 145 USD. Compared to my expenses in PP it makes sense to wait the extra days until Monday. And I get a lot of stuff done in the coffee shops in this time. We officially start on October 27th, 5 weeks after the welcome ceremony on September 21st. But I’m in Hanoi for a wedding, and two more students are still in China. So we meet virtually on Google Meet – that does not work in China. We figure out, that Zoom does not work either. But Dr. Tâm is welcoming us all and giving us the important information we need. Two weeks later, on November 10th, I’m finally in class in person! Time to learn Vietnamese, with 7 weeks delay. To catch up will take some time. But we’re still not complete! One week later our department postpones the celebration of Teachers day from Thursday, November 20th to Tuesday, November 18th. Now we have at least a group picture of 6 of us in the auditorium with 600 Vietnamese students: 6 students on November 18th in the auditorium Read more about it at Teacher day in Vietnam . One day later (November 19th) we’re finally complete! So what is the history of course 615 – Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn hoá Việt Nam ? A conversation with Mrs. Tâm on Friday, December 19th, gives me further insight. Course 615 in the past When we open our book 1 and 2, we see that the printing was ordered 1000 copies of book 1 in 2016 (with two different editions in our class) and 500 copies of book 2 in 2015. This is at least the second iteration, only book 4 should still be very old. In the years prior to Covid-19 many students from Korea attended the university to learn Vietnamese. Their parents worked at companies in Saigon, and large classes of up to 35 students learned more about the Vietnamese language and culture of Vietnam. Another group signing up for university were students from Afrika. One student was also signing up his sister, father, mother and aunt. For about 1000 USD each got a one year multi entry visa for Vietnam that would otherwise be more expensive or not attainable. But the immigration office had already started to crack down on this practice and required the students to actually show up to class, not just on day one. This “loophole” was already fixed in the 2010s. But with all the restrictions during the pandemic time the class K45 (2019-2023) had to start studying online in 2020. With the uncertainty K46 was not started in 2020. While the situation was rather safe in Vietnam, international travel would not have foreigners enter the country, and K45 had already returned home. In early 2021 Saigon was severly affected by the Omicron variant. And while vaccinations were slowly rolling out in summer, the city went into lockdown from June to August 2021. Many were stuck in Phu Quoc, and three months of only virtual activity meant that there was also no K47. The numbers then never returned to normal. Currently K48 and K49 have only 2 students, so these 4 students learn together now. Name of the Class Years of Study Number of Students Minimum number of St. K45 2019-2023 35 K46 2020-2024 – K47 2021-2025 – K48 2022-2026 2 ? K49 2023-2027 2 ? K50 2024-2028 0 15 K51 2025-2029 7 10 Yet without students the ministry of education would eventually delete course 615. This assessment is done every 3 years. Two very low student years and one year without students meant to lower the requirement to just 10 students for K51 – and even that could not be met. Well, we are at least 7 students, and for the second semester we might get some exchange students from Taiwan. So far this course is still alive. Let’s see what happens next year. And if we can finish our bachelor. study Su Pham ← Reactivation 2025 Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

About Hofkoh Saigon Reactivation 2025 Written by Matthias in Projects After years of contemplating I finally simplified my websites to just two sites: saiht.de and kreier.org . I found three different older WordPress installations, and combined them here into saiht.de/blog . And even though https encrypted subdomains work again, I keep it in the subfolder for the time being. Both at the same time does not work with PHP and WordPress. I’ll just use it for some static pages with relative folders or static link addresses. During the years 2008 to 2016 I was writing in German. Now in 2025 I finally switched to English. Maybe I will translate some of the older posts one day, and will have to adapt the tags. Time will tell. So far there are 93 posts here over the last 19 years: As of today, December 18th, 2025, this wordpress installation is live again. More statistics on notetaking, diaries and projects is about to follow. I currently use 23 subdomains at kreier.org : 7 related to projects, 2 to school and 3 to “Schule” – from the older hofkoh.de site. The saiht.de site has 27 subdomains, but more on that later. website ← Teacher day in Vietnam History of course 615 → Comments One response to “Reactivation 2025” December 18, 2025 A WordPress Commenter Hi, this is a comment.
